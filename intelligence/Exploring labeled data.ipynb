      "Commander Nazir group and its leader Malang Wazir has been desginated among the Specially Designated Global Terrorists by US Statement Department. According to a statement released by US Department of State, the commander Nazir group has been alleged to run training camps for terrorists, sent suicide bombers, provided sanctuary for al Qaeda fighters and conducted cross-border operations against the US and its allies in Afghanistan. The source further added, “In addition to its attacks against international forces in Afghanistan, CNG [commander Nazir group] is also responsible for assassinations and intimidation operations against civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan.” The statement also added that after the death of Mullah Nazir earlier this year the group had chosen Malang Wazir to become part of their top leadership. The group also issued a statement that they would continue to support al Qaeda and their attacks in Afghanistan. State also noted that the Mullah Nazir Group and Commander Malang, who was added to the US’s list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists today, have conducted several attacks against the Pakistani military. “Malang claimed CNG responsibility for a March 2008 vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack in front of an army brigade headquarters in Zari Noor, South Waziristan, Pakistan, which killed five Pakistani soldiers and injured 11 more,” according to the designation. Additionally, the Mullah Nazir Group “broke a ceasefire agreement and attacked a Pakistani army camp in Wana, Pakistan, with missiles and rockets” in May 2011. Mullah Nazir was killed in a drone strike early this year, and the group has chosen Malang Wazir as part of the top leadership. In the meantime the group has also reportedly issued a statement that they would continue to support Al -Qaeda and attacks in Afghanistan . The group has also claimed responsibility for attacks in Pakistan.   Post Views:  230\n",

      "Two suspected members of the militant Islamic State group allegedly linked to the 2013 abduction of former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's son, Ali Haider Gilani, were killed in a pre-dawn raid on a 'militant hideout' in Faisalabad on Tuesday, a Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official said.  CTD official Rai Tahir identified the two militants as Adeel Hafeez and Usman Haroon. He said both were killed during an intense shootout in the raid conducting by security officials.  Tahir said officials had, in the past, foiled other attacks the pair had plotted, adding that they were also behind the killing of two intelligence officials in recent years as well as other high-profile crimes.  The two militants were also linked to the 2011 Al Qaeda abduction of an American development worker , Warren Weinstein, the official said. Weinstein, who was taken from Lahore, was accidentally killed in a United States drone strike in 2015 on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He provided no specific information about the role the two had in Weinstein's case.  The American worker's accidental death was announced by Washington in 2015. President Barack Obama at the time said he took full responsibility for US counter-terror missions and offered his condolences to families of the hostages.  After the Sept 11 attacks in the United States, Washington aggressively targeted militant hideouts in neighbouring Afghanistan and Pakistan's tribal regions, killing local and foreign militants. Pakistan considers US drone strikes a violation of its sovereignty, while the US accuses Pakistan of providing safe havens for militants. Pakistan has always denied the charge, saying it acts against militants without discrimination.  Many former Al Qaeda militants are thought to have joined the regional IS affiliate, which emerged a few years ago, around the time the group was at the height of its caliphate in Iraq and Syria. IS has since lost nearly all the territory it once controlled in the two Middle Eastern countries. \n",

      "The former president of Pakistan Gen. Pervez Musharraf admitted his government secretly signed off on U.S. drone strikes. This is the first time a former senior Pakistani official has publicly acknowledged to such a deal with CIA, amid open challenges by Pakistani leaders for having no part in drone deal with the United States. Despite Pakistan had no role to oversee the program or approve every attack however Musharraf’s admission suggests that himself and others did play some role in drone strikes. While speaking during an interview with the CNN, Musharraf insisted Pakistan’s government signed off on strikes “only on a few occasions, when a target was absolutely isolated and no chance of collateral damage.” According to a nonpartisan public policy group New American Foundation, at least 1,990 people including civilians have been killed during the drone strikes in Pakistan. Drone strikes for the first time were launched in 2004 during the leadership of Pervez Musharraf while he was serving as Pakistan president for five years term. He said that Pakistani leaders would OK U.S. drone strikes after discussions involving military and intelligence units and only if “there was no time for our own ... military to act.” Musharraf also confirmed that Nek Mohammad, a tribal leader accused of harboring al Qaeda militants in Pakistan’s western border region was killed in US drone attack.

      " WASHINGTON — Iraq’s battle to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State group is progressing despite “stiff” resistance from resilient and creative fighters, but a coming offensive to oust them from their main Syria stronghold at Raqqa poses tougher political challenges and could take longer, the U.S. commander of anti-IS coalition forces said Wednesday.  Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend also said American intelligence has detected indistinct signs of Islamic State plotting against the West from Raqqa, adding urgency to coalition plans to encircle and eventually assault the city.   “We know they’re up to something, and it’s an external plot,” the general told reporters at the Pentagon, speaking from his headquarters in Baghdad. “We don’t know exactly where” they intend to strike, he added. “We don’t know exactly when.”  “We know this plot-and-planning is emanating from Raqqa. We think we’ve got to get to Raqqa pretty soon.” He declined to be more precise about a timeline but said there is “a sense of urgency” due to the uncertainty of the threat.  As the Islamic State group’s two main hubs, Mosul and Raqqa have long loomed as potentially decisive battles. The group has lost considerable territory elsewhere in both Iraq and Syria over the past year, and the U.S. and its coalition partners see collapsing their last major strongholds as a key to extinguishing extremist claims to a caliphate.  Townsend and other coalition leaders are struggling with the timing for Raqqa, not only because of the demands of the large Iraqi-led Mosul operation but also because the political and military landscape in Syria is more complicated. Townsend said more Syrian opposition fighters need to be recruited, trained and equipped for the Raqqa battle, but he and other officials have said in recent days that the Mosul and Raqqa operations will overlap.  “I think it will be within weeks,” Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in Brussels, adding, “Not many weeks.”  Unlike in Iraq, where the coalition has a coherent government to work with, the U.S. and its coalition partners in Syria are relying on a hodge-podge of local Arab and Kurdish opposition groups, some of whom are fierce rivals. The tensions are exacerbated by the presence of Russian and Syrian forces on one side and Turkish forces on another.  “It’s probably fair to say with the complexity and the fact that we haven’t really got it underway yet that it’ll probably take longer than Mosul,” Townsend said, referring to the Raqqa offensive. He and other officials have avoided predicting how long it will take to oust IS from Mosul, but they have suggested it could take a number of months.  Townsend acknowledged that a ground offensive in Raqqa is politically fraught, given the diverse and competing ethnic groups in Syria and demands by Turkey that the Syrian Kurdish fighting force known as the YPG, which the Turks regard as an enemy, not participate in the Raqqa assault.  He said plainly that the YPG will necessarily be part of the offensive.  “The facts are these: The only force that is capable on any near-term timeline is the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion,” Townsend said. “So, we’re negotiating, we’re planning, we’re having talks with Turkey and we’re gonna take this in steps. And we think there’s an imperative to get isolation in place around Raqqa because our intelligence feeds tell us that there is significant external operations attacks planning going on, centralized in Raqqa.”   The battle for Mosul is the most important of the two-year campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. Judy Woodruff speaks with retired Gen. David Petraeus, former commander of the Multi-National Force Iraq, about the current combat mission, as well as what he says is the greater challenge of governance of the region after ISIS has been dislodged.  Townsend gave a mostly upbeat assessment of progress in the Iraqi push toward Mosul, which began last week. The extremists, who have controlled Mosul for more than two years, are “fighting very hard,” offering “pretty stiff resistance,” he said.  “They’ve pulled out all stops,” he said, including suicide attacks, car bombs, mortars and roadside bombs. He credited IS with innovative uses of small drones. “It’s not episodic or sporadic,” he said. “It’s relatively constant and creative.”  The drones, which he called “a pretty thorny problem,” are being used not only for surveillance and to guide mortar or artillery fire but also as Trojan horses. Townsend cited an example of an IS drone landing, seemingly harmlessly, behind Iraqi lines. It exploded when Iraqi soldiers picked it up for examination, killing or wounding them, Townsend said.  “We expect to see more of this,” he said.  Townsend said the indications of IS plotting Western attacks from Raqqa have not caused the coalition to accelerate its Raqqa operation. He outlined a phased approach to spoiling the plots, starting with “trying to head it off” by using airstrikes against targets around Raqqa.  “We’re going to do those kinds of suppressive fires until we’re ready to mount an approach and isolation of Raqqa,” he said.  Once the city is isolated, he said, a ground offensive will be launched to expel IS from the city it regards as its capital.  Townsend said some aspects of the Raqqa assault plan are yet to be worked out and will be decided by local commanders.  “Syrian commanders will make decisions about what needs to be done there to completely encircle, to partially encircle and to attack from this direction or attack from that direction,” he said. “They’ll make those decisions. We haven’t reached that stage of the planning with them yet.”  WATCH: Petraeus says there’s a bigger challenge to come once Iraq retakes Mosul from ISIS \n",

      " ATAQ, Yemen — Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains — that’s what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.  Early that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. “Let me sleep,” Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.  One word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn’t returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.  They were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.      They knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive.   They knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.  They knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.  And they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far — just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.  No one had, and his parents’ worry grew to panic.  ___  All around al-Said district, in Yemen’s southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.  That wasn’t unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.  From above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.  Abdullah’s village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.  Al-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.      For more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen.   For more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years — 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people — militants and civilians — were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.  At least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah’s disappearance, a drone’s missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.  But here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.  ___  Soon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.  Abdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn’t want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.  The boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.  They caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.  Abdullah loved Ataq — the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.  It was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.  ___  Abdullah’s parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.  What if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.  Abdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah’s brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.      “If you saw him, you’d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand.”   “If you saw him, you’d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,” Mohsanaa said.  When Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn’t let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months “he became a normal baby,” she said.  In an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah’s father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.  Saleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen’s biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn’t reach the pedals yet.  He always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.  “You just study, and I will take care of everything else,” Saleh told him. “I don’t want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn’t finish school.”  Now his boy had vanished.  Saleh’s eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week’s leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they’d seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?  Finally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He’d seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.      “Things happen at night.”   Saleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.  As night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh’s brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city’s edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.  Mohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn’t want them driving around in the dark.  “Things happen at night,” she said.  ___  On the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn’t told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn’t have the nerve to say anything.  They passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters’ camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: “I am with al-Qaida. I’ll come back tomorrow. Don’t come for me.”  The boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.  ___  When he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah’s father tried calling back to the militant’s phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else “I won’t be able to get him back.” Once in al-Qaida’s hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt — or he might be hit by a drone.  With al-Qaida, “all roads lead to death,” said one of Saleh’s nephews.  Despite his wife’s warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh’s nephews who offered to help.  The search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.      With al-Qaida, “all roads lead to death.”   Saleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn’t have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.  The al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn’t there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.  Mubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.  Mubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.  As the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh’s taxi.  ___  At around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base — perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia — launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.  The hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father’s taxi.  The missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah’s father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.  There were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.  “It was shocking. I wept,” Abdullah said. “I realized he had come looking for me.”  ____  News of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.  One of Mubarak’s brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.  “He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,” he said of Mubarak. “He was doing something good and got killed.”  In Ataq, one of Saleh’s nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. “Your brothers and uncle are in God’s embrace,” a neighbor said.  The remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah’s odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh’s legs were gone; Zayad’s body was cut in half.  In keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.  Abdullah’s mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.  “It’s not possible. We talked in the evening,” Mohsanaa said. “I told them not to go out at night.”  She was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.  Then Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.  Tribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.  “It was my all mistake,” Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.      “I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.”   “I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.”  The Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.  Ever since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could — police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals — certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.  They even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.  Their voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed — a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded — but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh’s family to submit evidence that they were civilians.  Abdullah’s family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.  Mohsanaa doesn’t believe she’ll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family’s grief. She doesn’t speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn’t blame himself.  “This is God’s verdict. If it wasn’t written, they wouldn’t have gone,” Mohsanaa said. “What’s the child’s guilt? He is a victim. He’s a poor boy.”  ___  This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting . Associated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed. \n",

      "President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani says all Afghan refugees should return back to Afghanistan particularly from Pakistan in next twenty four months. Speaking during a gathering to mark the 29th year of the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, President Ghani said the government is committed to bring changes in its priorities in a bid to pave the way for the return of the refugees. President Ghani further added that he wants all the refugees to return to the country in the next 24 months, insisting that the government does not want the issue of the refugees remain an excuse for the Pakistani authorities. This comes as the foreign ministry of Pakistan in reaction to a drone strike on Haqqani terrorist network member said last month that “Pakistan has also been stressing the need of early repatriation of Afghan refugees as their presence in Pakistan helps Afghan terrorists to melt and morph among them.” The Minister of Interior of Pakistan Ahsan Iqbal had earlier said that the return of Afghan refugees is prerequisite to deny safe havens to the Afghan militants. Iqbal told reporters that around three million refugees still reside in Pakistan emphasizing that no one should expect that the country would be able to certify those involved in the cross-border terrorist activities. According to Iqbal, Pakistan cold only guarantee having no terrorists on its soil when all refugees return to their homeland.   Post Views:  263\n",

      "Hours after a deadly US airstrike left several militants dead in Kurram Agency of Pakistan, the country’s foreign minister Khawaja Asif called on the United States to stop airstrikes amid ongoing efforts to revive the Afghan peace process. Asif was speaking to a private TV channel after a series of airstrikes targeted a compound of the notorious Haqqani terrorist network in Kurram Agency, located in the tribal regions of the country. Following the strike, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said on a Geo News programme that the United States should not conduct any drone strikes in either Afghanistan or Pakistan at a time when Afghan peace talks have resumed, according to the private TV channel. According to the local security and intelligence officials, the airstrikes were carried out late on Monday night. The officials further added that several missiles were fired on a compound of the terror network, leaving at least twenty of them dead. According to the officials, the missiles were apparently fired from the unmanned aerial vehicles belonging to the US forces with the initial reports indicating at least five were killed. However, the officials said the dead bodies of at least fifteen more were recovered in the aftermath of the airstrikes. The target of the airstrikes was believed to be a commander of the Haqqani terrorist network identified as Abu Bakar.   Post Views:  303\n",

      " MOSCOW — Russia has tested an array of new strategic nuclear weapons that can’t be intercepted, President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday, marking a technological breakthrough that could dramatically increase Russia’s military capability, boost the Kremlin’s global position and open a new round in the global arms race.  Speaking in a state-of-the-nation speech, Putin said the weapons include a nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-powered underwater drone and new hypersonic missile that have no equivalent elsewhere in the world. He said the creation of the new weapons has made NATO’s U.S.-led missile defense “useless,” and means an effective end to what he described as Western efforts to stymie Russia’s development.  “I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,” he said. “You have failed to contain Russia.”      “You have failed to contain Russia.”   The announcement comes as Putin is set to easily win another six-year presidential term in the March 18 election. He said that the nuclear-powered cruise missile tested last fall has a “practically unlimited” range and high speed and maneuverability allowing it to pierce any missile defense.  The Russian leader said the high-speed underwater drone also has an “intercontinental” range and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could target both aircraft carriers and coastal facilities. He said its operational depth and high speed would make it immune to enemy intercept.  Putin noted that the tests of the compact nuclear reactor to power the new drone were completed last fall.  He added, to applause, that names for the nuclear-powered cruise missile and the drone haven’t yet been chosen, and suggested that the Defense Ministry run a nationwide contest for the best names.  Putin accompanied his statement to an audience of hundreds of senior officials and lawmakers with videos and computer images of new weapons, which were shown on giant screens at a conference hall near the Kremlin.  “No one in the world has anything like that,” he said. “It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.”      “No one in the world has anything like that. It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.”   The Russian leader said that another new weapon called Avangard is an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly to targets at a speed 20 times the speed of sound and strike “like a meteorite, like a fireball.”  Putin said that Russia also tested a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, called Sarmat, with a range and number of warheads exceeding its Soviet-era predecessor, known in the West as Satan.  The Russian leader emphasized that the development of new weapons that have no equivalent in the West came in response to the U.S. withdrawal from a Cold war-era treaty banning missile defenses and U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system.  He said that the U.S. has ignored Russian complaints.  “No one has listened to us,” he said. “You listen to us now.”  He said the new weapons will help ensure global stability and draw a line under attempts to weaken Russia.  He said that another weapons system, called Kinzhal, already has been deployed in Russia’s Southern Military District. He said it’s a hypersonic missile carried by an aircraft that can strike targets 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) away. \n",

The report further adds that 1,149 children were also injured in various incidents where militant groups were involved. Hezb-e-Islami party and the Taliban militants group was blamed for the majority of the children deaths in Afghanistan. UN in its report also added that improvised explosive device (IED) and suicide attacks were the main causes for the death of children in Afghanistan. In the meantime, UN said 81 children were killed in pro-government forces operations and 125 others were injured. 27 children were killed in NATO forces air raids and 19 others were injured, the report said, adding that 2 children were killed ad 59 civilians were injured in drone strikes.

Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) following a statement, said, “The Taliban want to negotiate with the government with full sincerity and seriousness.” The statement further added that the TTP has “evolved a consensus on setting up such a team that could contact the government’s team easily, and that could relay the Taliban’s view to the government and Muslims of Pakistan effectively”. In the meantime, Imran Khan’s party – Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf, following a statement, said that Khan was unlikely to accept the role but he would probably prefer to assist the peace process in another role. The other team members named by the Taliban group includes Maulana Abdul Aziz, the chief cleric of Islamabd’s Red Mosque and three top religious party leaders includig Maulana Sami-ul-Haq, Mufti Kifayatullah and Prof Ibrahim Khan. The TTP spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid quoted by AFP said, “The committee members will hold talks with their interlocutors in the government’s team on our behalf and put forth our point of view.” Mr. Khan strongly backs negotiations with the Taliban group in Pakistan and has criticized the U.S. drone strikes targeting militants in the area.

      "     A militant from the Palestinian Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine jumps over burning tires during a demonstration in Ain al-Helweh refugee camp near the Lebanese city of Sidon. Photo by Mahmoud Zayat/AFP/Getty Images.  International criticism against an Israeli raid on a humanitarian flotilla delivering aid to the Gaza Strip intensified on Tuesday, as the United Nations Security Council issued a statement against the operation that resulted in nine deaths and called for an impartial investigation into the incident.  “The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting form the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza,” the statement read in part .   It was reached following a marathon negotiating session that lasted nearly 12 hours. As the BBC reports :  “The UN statement was the result of a compromise between Turkey and the United States, with Turkey reluctant to water down its trenchant criticism of Israel while the United States, Israel’s closest ally, wanted to temper the language used.”  Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that four Turkish citizens were among the dead .  Reports from Cairo said Egypt had offered a temporary easing of its own restrictions, opening its border with Gaza for a limited period to permit humanitarian aid to reach the 1.5 million people there.  Meantime, Israel continued its defense of Monday’s raid , releasing a video showing its soldiers being attacked with metal poles and chairs while attempting to board one of the ships in the flotilla.  The aid mission’s organizers, meanwhile, were preparing a second attempt to breach Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza.  Foreign Policy’s Blake Hounshell explains “Why the Gaza boat deaths are a big deal”:  [T]here’s a huge unwillingness on the Israeli right to face reality — that Israel is fast losing friends and allies in the world, and that this government in Jerusalem has only accelerated the shift. It’s not hard to imagine boycott campaigns gaining momentum, damaging the Israeli economy and isolating the country diplomatically, especially in Europe.  BP Facing $990 Million Bill  With BP’s costs for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill now at $990 million, the company is preparing as early as Wednesday to begin yet another attempt to plug the six-week-old leak.  The pending operation involves using a dome to catch oil from the damaged pipeline some 5,000 feet below the surface. The company attempted a similar procedure in early May. This time around, however, BP engineers say they have resolved some of the technical problems that forced them to abandon the first attempt.  The Associate Press notes :  “The best hope for stopping the flow of oil from the blown-out well...has been compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate with a drill more than two miles into the earth, and is anything but a sure bet on the first attempt.”  While BP readies for the so-called cut-and-cap operation, Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to the Gulf Coast on Tuesday to survey the spill and meet with the attorneys general from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi to determine whether federal criminal charges should be filed against BP.  Al-Qaida No. 3 Is Killed  Al-Qaida has confirmed that its No. 3 official, Mustafa al-Yazid, has been killed . The group did not say how or where al-Yazid died. It is believed that he was killed by an American missile strike in Pakistan’s tribal region in late May. Al-Yazid, an Egyptian, was a founding member of the terror group and its top commander in Afghanistan. \n",

      "ISLAMABAD: A total of 409 drone attacks have been conducted in Pakistan since January 2004, in which 2,714 people have been killed and 728 injured.  The majority of the strikes were carried out during the government of Pakistan Peoples Party between 2008 and 2012. Sources within the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) recently shared details, claiming that the period saw 336 aerial attacks, in which 2,282 people lost their lives and 658 received injuries.

In 2018, two drone attacks have been conducted so far. One person was killed and one was injured.  It is, however, worth remembering that the top leadership of the Taliban in Pakistan has been killed in drone attacks.  The attacks over the years have targeted the areas of Bajaur, Bannu, Hangu, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, North Waziristan, Nushki, Orakzai, and South Waziristan.

The attacks, they said, mostly targeted Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) and were carried out through different methods that included bomb explosions, hand grenade attacks, mine explosions, missiles, rockets, and suicide attacks. Terrorists also targeted minorities geared to instigate sectarian violence and employed sophisticated methods, including the usage of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) — vehicle explosive devices as well as radio controlled improvised devices.  During the current year — 2018 — 405 terrorist attacks have taken place in the country, in which 133 officials and 233 civilians have been killed and 348 personnel and 567 civilians have been injured.  In Punjab, 14 incidents of bomb blasts, suicide attacks and engagements with terrorists led to the deaths of six LEA officials and as many civilians during the year. Four officials and 52 civilians have so far been injured.  Sindh has seen 11 incidents of terror related attacks, which included strikes on LEAs, through bomb explosions, hand grenade attacks and general aggressive engagement with terrorists. The province has also had to contend with suicide attacks and IED explosions. Two LEA officials and as many civilians lost their lives and eight officials as well as six civilians have been injured.  There were 51 incidents targeting LEAs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the year. 21 personnel and 11 civilians have been killed and 55 officials and 57 civilians have been injured in these attacks.

      " NEW YORK — The United States and Russia are taking their differences over the conflict in Syria to new heights, after trading ferocious allegations of duplicity and malfeasance at the United Nations Security Council.  After a fractious meeting of the council on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were set to duel again at a gathering of foreign ministers from the roughly 20 nations that have interests in Syria. Thursday’s meeting of the International Syria Support Group comes after the two blamed each other for spoiling the country’s cease-fire that they had agreed to only two weeks before.  Amid deep pessimism over whether the truce could be resurrected, the group was to consider a U.S. call for all warplanes to halt flights over aid routes following an attack on a humanitarian convoy near the besieged city of Aleppo and a Russian suggestion for a three-day pause in fighting to get the so-called “cessation of hostilities” back on track. However, diplomats said prospects for the success of either idea were unclear.  The meeting also comes after Syrian President Bashar Assad blamed the U.S. for the collapse of the cease-fire in an interview with The Associated Press in Damascus. Assad said the U.S. lacked “the will” to join forces with Russia in fighting extremists and rejected Washington’s claim that airstrikes last week on Syrian troops were accidental.  The diametrically opposed views of Washington and Moscow were underscored at the Security Council meeting that had originally been called to enshrine the Sept. 9 truce. Instead, members rued the possibility of a darker phase in the conflict amid increased attacks on humanitarian workers. And, in unusually blunt language, they illustrated why they’ve been unable for more than five years to stop Syria’s civil war.      “Everybody sits there and says we want a united Syria, secular, respecting the rights of all people, in which the people of Syria can choose their leadership. But we are proving woefully inadequate in our ability to be able to get to the table and have that conversation and make it happen.” — Secretary of State John Kerry   “Supposedly we all want the same goal. I’ve heard that again and again,” a visibly angry Kerry told the council. “Everybody sits there and says we want a united Syria, secular, respecting the rights of all people, in which the people of Syria can choose their leadership. But we are proving woefully inadequate in our ability to be able to get to the table and have that conversation and make it happen.”  While the U.S. and Russia have previously butted heads over several proposed resolutions critical of the Syrian government, Wednesday’s agenda didn’t even include a suggested course of action. Instead, the two-hour discussion served as a warm-up act for Thursday’s meeting.  Kerry blamed Russia, lambasting what he portrayed as a cynical response to an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy this week that killed 20 civilians and raised “profound doubt” about Russia’s and Syria’s willingness to abide by the cease-fire. The U.S. believes that a Russian-piloted aircraft carried out the strike, said a senior American official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.  Russia has denied U.S. claims that it was responsible, but Kerry focused on its shifting explanation of what might have happened.  First, Kerry said, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary described the attack as a “necessary response” to an alleged offensive by al-Qaida-linked militants elsewhere in the country. Then, a Russian ambassador said forces were targeting another area.  Russia’s Defense Ministry followed by saying the aid convoy was accompanied by militants in a pickup truck with a mortar, Kerry said, adding that no such evidence exists. Then, the ministry denied any Russian or Syrian involvement as its spokesman suggested, in Kerry’s words, that “the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted.”  “This is not a joke,” Kerry exclaimed, urging all to stop the “word games that duck responsibility or avoid the choices … with respect to war and peace, life and death.” His pleas crossed paths with another statement by Russia’s government, this time suggesting a U.S. coalition Predator drone was operating nearby when the convoy attack occurred. The Pentagon said no drone was in the area at the time.  It was one of Kerry’s most bitter exchanges with Moscow as secretary of state, laced with invective and outrage.  But he also offered one concrete suggestion to revive diplomatic hopes: to ground all aircraft in key areas, focused on protecting aid routes in northern Syria.  Kerry spoke immediately after Lavrov, whose comments underscored a breakdown in trust since the pair sealed the cease-fire agreement and potential U.S.-Russian military partnership against the Islamic State and al-Qaida 12 days ago. Much of the international community hailed that outcome, only to watch it unravel amid an upsurge in violence that included an accidental U.S. strike that killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers.  Lavrov said the U.S. bore the biggest responsibility for peace by separating opposition forces from terrorists. He called for the U.N. to expand its terrorism list to include groups at the fringes of a U.S.-backed rebel umbrella group and called Washington’s errant strike an “outrageous violation.”  The Russian also cited a series of truce violations by U.S.-backed rebel groups near the northern city of Aleppo. And in a not-so-subtle jab at Washington, he called Syria’s conflict, as well as those in Iraq and Libya, the “direct consequence” of foreign military interventions and “political engineering.” \n",

      "The Ministry of Defense (MoD) has confirmed the Afghan commandos and a policeman were killed in an airstrike conducted by the Afghan Air Force. MoD spokesman Dawlat Waziri said the airstrike was called in after the Taliban militants launched a coordinated attack on several security posts in Bala Bolok district. He said the airstrike mistakenly targeted the security forces due to a false coordination given by the security forces on the ground. Waziri further added that the Afghan Air Force helicopters bombed the security forces and a delegation has been assigned to further investigate the incident. This comes as reports emerged earlier suggesting that the 5 commandos and a policeman were killed in an airstrike carried out by the US forces in Afghanistan. However the coalition rejected the reports as false and said the US forces have not conducted any airstrike in the past one week in Farah province. The allegations against the US forces came days after at least 15 civilians were killed in a drone strike in Eastern Nangarhar province of Afghanistan. The civilians were targeted as the US forces and the Afghan security forces are busy in conducting counter-terrorism operations against the loyalists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in this province.

      "BAGHOUZ, Syria (Reuters) - Islamic State launched two counter-attacks on U.S.-backed fighters besieging their final shred of territory in eastern Syria on Wednesday but were beaten back without any progress, the Syrian Democratic Forces said. FILE PHOTO: Fighters of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stand near Islamic state fighters and their families who surrendered in the village of Baghouz, Deir Al Zor province, Syria March 12, 2019. REUTERS/Rodi Said The jihadists, waging a last-ditch battle in Baghouz, a collection of hamlets and farmland near the Iraqi border, dispatched suicide bombers against SDF fighters, who thwarted the attacks, the U.S.-backed force said. Islamic State launched the second counter-attack in the afternoon, “(taking) advantage of smoke and dust over Baghouz”, the SDF media office said. “Fighting is still continuing. (Islamic State) made no progress so far and were stopped.” Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, said the heavy clashes led to the death of 38 militants including eight suicide bombers while four SDF fighters were killed. There were advances on some points, Bali said. Black smoke mushroomed high over Baghouz as the sounds of gunfire, explosions and planes could be heard in a battle that the SDF has said is as good as over. In parts of Baghouz already under SDF control, dirt roads were littered with the scorched remains of cars, trucks and motorcycles. Many houses had been completely flattened and roads had been cratered by missile strikes. Islamic State’s black flag could still be seen painted on walls, while others had been emblazoned with freshly daubed SDF slogans and the words “Down with Daesh”, an Arabic acronym for the jihadists. Islamic State (IS) held roughly one third of Syria and Iraq at the zenith of its power in 2014, when its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself “caliph”, or leader of all the world’s Muslims. Subsequently, IS was steadily beaten back by a range of enemies including the U.S.-led international coalition, suffering its major defeats in 2017 when it lost the Iraqi city of Mosul and its Syrian headquarters at Raqqa. No Islamic State leaders are believed to be in Baghouz, according to a U.S. defence official. U.S. government experts strongly believe Baghdadi is alive and possibly hiding in Iraq. The group is still assessed to remain a potent security threat operating in remote territory in both Syria and Iraq. Bali said SDF forces had bombarded Baghouz heavily overnight before engaging in direct clashes with IS fighters in the pre-dawn hours. Live footage broadcast by Kurdish Ronahi TV showed a series of large blasts lighting up the night sky over Baghouz. SUICIDE ASSAULTS “There were suicide vest attacks by a group of bombers who tried to blow themselves up amidst our forces. Our forces targeted and killed them before they reached our positions,” Bali said. The SDF has laid siege to Baghouz for weeks but had repeatedly postponed its final assault to allow thousands of civilians, many of them wives and children of Islamic State fighters, to leave. It resumed the attack on Sunday. The U.S. led aerial coalition campaign to end the militants’ last territorial enclave has exacted a heavy human toll with hundreds of casualties among civilians from intense aerial bombardment that has razed many villages to the ground, former residents and aid workers say. Around 3,000 IS fighters and their families surrendered to SDF forces in 24 hours, Bali said overnight. Three women and four children belonging to the Yazidi sect, a minority group who were kidnapped and enslaved by IS in 2014, were also freed, he said. Islamic State put out a new propaganda video overnight Monday filmed in recent weeks inside Baghouz, maintaining its claim to leadership of all Muslims and calling on its supporters to keep the faith. “Tomorrow, God willing, we will be in paradise and they will be burning in hell,” one of the men interviewed in the video said. [nL8N20Z23H] Though Islamic State is on the verge of losing its last piece of territory, Syria remains carved up among other parties to its multi-sided conflict: President Bashar al-Assad’s government, the Kurdish-led SDF, and anti-government rebels. The war has escalated in recent weeks with the Assad government stepping up its shelling of opposition held towns in the northwestern region of Idlib, where Islamist militant group Tahrir al-Sham holds sway. Related Coverage Syrian forces intensify attacks on last rebel bastion U.S. sees Turkish offensive in Syria as unnecessary - U.S. official Overnight, government forces rained incendiary bombs on the area, where a full-scale offensive was averted in September by an agreement brokered by Assad’s Russian allies and Turkey, which backs his opponents and has forces on the ground. Russian warplanes struck for the first time in months the centre of Idlib city, including a hospital and a prison on the  outskirts from which dozens of inmates fled, residents said. The Russian defence ministry said they targeted a weapons store by Tahrir al Sham where it said the jihadists planned a drone attack on a Russian air base near the Mediterranean.

      "By Manish Rai Nearly three years of bloody civil war in Syria have created what the United Nations, governments and international humanitarian organizations describe as the most challenging refugee crisis in a generation bigger than the one unleashed by the Rwandan genocide and laden with the sectarianism of the Balkan wars. With no end in sight in the conflict and with large parts of Syria already destroyed, governments and organizations are quietly preparing for the refugee crisis to last years. Governments and humanitarian groups are increasingly working under the assumption that the crisis will be a long-lasting one. This is the crisis that has been called the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of this century and condemned by the UN as a “disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history”. The United Nations has asked for more than $5 billion in humanitarian aid this year for Syria, its biggest financial appeal ever for a single crisis. But amidst politically-charged debates on the use of chemical weapons, military drone strikes and UN intervention, the real victims of the Syrian civil war, its refugees and its children, are slowly being relegated to the background. It is becoming a political issue, rather than a human one. The number of refugees fleeing over the Syrian borders to Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq to escape the violent conflict reached 2 million. Currently, it is estimated that over 2.5 million persons have fled the conflict, more than half of whom are believed to be children. The UN confirmed that thousands of new refugees had fled to Lebanon to escape fighting in the Qalamoun mountains on the Lebanese border. Many of these refugees are families, arriving with only the clothes on their back. The Syrian conflict is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time in terms of brutality, numbers affected and the impact on children. With no resolution in sight, there is the potential for an entire generation of Syrian children to be deprived of access to a permanent home, formal education and basic health needs. The impact of this will reverberate not only for generations of Syrians to come, but will also be felt in those neighbouring countries who have openly accepted victims of war seeking refuge, and whose own services now face severe stress. For many children however, after having already missed two years of schooling in Syria, attending school is simply too difficult. Some are set to work in order to sustain their families, and girls in particular often stay in the makeshift settlements to care for younger children. The gains made in female education in Syria in the past are regressing as a result of the refugee crisis. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the Syrian refugee crisis. It is, after all, the biggest humanitarian crisis in modern history with nearly 4 million Syrians one million of them children forced out of their country by the civil war. But, with the conflict and its impact expected to drag on for years, the aid agencies must also plan for the longer term. This includes building capacity in neighbouring states, as the World Bank is doing in Jordan and Lebanon, to provide services for refugees. The life of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is not better then the refugees who have crossed into the neighbouring countries they often find refuge in the poorest and most marginalized regions of the country, which frequently lack proper infrastructure to deal with the population influx. But they are often even harder to reach, as many remain in conflict areas. Staying with relatives or in abandoned properties moving through fields and along roads. And always they are stalked by the bitter war that has torn this country apart the past three years claiming about 126,000 lives, laying waste to infrastructure, and threatening to ignite a broader, regional confrontation. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates  that some 4.5 million Syrians have been displaced within Syria’s borders as the country’s internecine conflict grinds on, exacting its brutal toll. IDPs have often been the invisible and forgotten victims of this brutal conflict and are largely sidelined by the political wrangling between all parties to the conflict and their international backers. Fears continue to mount that Syria’s internally displaced will go hungry with aid agencies unable to reach many in need because of security risks. Moreover measles and acute diarrhea cases are increasing, and WHO has warned the likelihood of outbreaks of water-borne diseases typhoid, cholera and hepatitis among IDP. The United Nation estimates that 2.5 million civilians lack food, water, and medicines, because some towns and villages are too hard to reach, with an estimated 250,000 people completely cut off from outside help. Only 60% of aid pledges have come in, with only a fraction actually reaching the intended beneficiaries. Although some agencies have been able to get aid supplies across national borders, they cannot get through the front lines of the fighting to reach those caught in the crossfire. In a nutshell we can just say that humanity is dying in Syria and the whole world community should do something to save it. International diplomatic efforts must therefore focus on achieving temporary ceasefires to bring in the most urgently needed help, such as polio vaccines for children as new cases of polio is being registered among the refugees. Aid should not be a mere side show to the seemingly endless peace talks taking place in Geneva. In order to ensure that an entire generation of Syrian children is not lost to history, we must pay attention to the issues before us for longer than the headlines. We must continue to support these victims of war for longer than a cake stall. We must keep giving, until the light at the end of the tunnel finally appears. Acting now, rather than waiting for a political solution, is a must. Resettlement of more Syrian refugees through a greater humanitarian intake, combined with a continued public giving program is the only way forward.

      " In his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump once again touched on the growing tensions between his White House and North Korea, calling Kim Jong Un’s regime “depraved” and saying its “reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.”  In a speech heavy on domestic issues, including taxes, infrastructure and immigration, the president also announced he had signed an executive order to keep Guantanamo Bay prison open – reversing the actions of his predecessor – and was working to fix unfair trade deals. “The era of economic surrender is totally over,” he said.   Watch the full State of the Union in the player above.  We asked experts what they learned — and what they didn’t — from Trump’s remarks on global issues during his first State of the Union.  Despite more strong rhetoric, Trump didn’t say anything new about his North Korea policy, said Frank Aum, senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Instead, he echoed past themes of “using ‘maximum pressure’ to prevent North Korea from achieving a nuclear missile capability and sought to draw a sharp distinction between his policy and the approaches of past administrations,” Aum said.  Frank Aum  “But Trump, underscoring a main point of his speech last year in Seoul, did emphasize human rights. He extrapolated the depraved character of the North Korean regime, using the tragic examples of Otto Warmbier and a North Korean defector named Ji Seong-ho, to underscore that the threat applies to everyone, including the United States and its allies,” said Aum. Trump did not mention diplomacy or engagement anywhere in the North Korea section of the speech.  The bigger news on North Korea, noted Aum, is that the nomination of Victor Cha for U.S. ambassador to South Korea will not be going forward. (Read the full report in the Washington Post.) Why? “He raised concerns about the administration’s consideration of a limited strike on North Korea,” Aum said. “If true, this report reveals the seriousness with which the administration is looking at military options as well as a problematic litmus test for future ambassadorial nominees.”  While pledging to fight until the Islamic State group is defeated, “the president did not address the more salient foreign policy question that preoccupies Middle Easterners (Arabs and Israelis alike): Who and what will fill the vacuum created by ISIS’ defeat?” said Robert Danin, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and at the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center’s Future of Diplomacy Project. “Specifically, will the United States remain engaged in the Middle East, and will the Trump administration devote resources — diplomatic, economic, or military — towards addressing the brutal conflict in Syria that has destabilized the region?” Robert Danin  Trump highlighted his decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but did not say how that “will help advance the goal of forging ‘the ultimate deal’ between Israelis and Palestinians,” Danin said. That’s striking because that is how he explained this policy shift in December. Instead, he registered his irritation at “countries that voted their disapproval of the Jerusalem recognition in the United Nations General Assembly, asking Congress to withhold foreign assistance money from those countries that are not America’s friends,” said Danin. Trump offered support for anti-regime Iranian protesters and criticized the Iran nuclear deal, “yet he provided no alternative vision or policies for Iran other than to reaffirm that he has asked Congress — rather than his own administration — to address the Iran deal’s flaws,” Danin said. “Nor did Trump address Iran’s regional expansionism, or provide any sense of American intention to counter Tehran’s nefarious intentions.” “For those who know the Twitter President, it was a pleasure to see Donald Trump using complete sentences, uttering complete thoughts, ignoring his adversaries, championing real people, real heroes, and glorying in his nation, not his ego,” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. But for those who care deeply about the safety and security of the American people, and the moral leadership of the United States in the world, it was light on substance, she said.  Danielle Pletka  Trump took close to an hour to get to national security, Pletka said, and while he highlighted some countries, he left many others out. “If we are with the people of Iran, let us also ask what of the people of Syria? Or China? What about the growing authoritarian threat of Russia, of Turkey, or of the specter of al-Qaida, flourishing even as ISIS fades?”  Is Trump “indifferent to those foreigners because we are about making America and Americans great again? Fair; but remember that every unfinished victory in Syria and Iraq, every drone strike in Afghanistan, leaves a vacuum that must be filled by something,” she said. “A great American leader will fashion strategies that ensure that ISIS and al Qaeda don’t return. A great American leader will remember that it is our values that distinguish us most, and mean we must stand up to the genuine threat that the People’s Republic of China and Putin’s Russia represent,” she added.  “If that leadership and those values were what you were listening for, you were sorely disappointed.”  But, according to James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation’s vice president of foreign and defense policy studies, the speech showed that “most of the concerns about the Trump approach to foreign policy have proven unfounded.  James Carafano  “The talk matches the walk. He is not an isolationist. He has not abandoned America’s friend and allies. He has not walked away from global institutions like the United Nations,” Carafano said.  “If anything, putting aside the tweets and off-hand comments, much of Trump’s foreign policy looks more traditional than that of President Bush or President Obama,” he continued. Trump “is not trying to reshape the world in America’s image, nor is he walking away from the responsibility to protect U.S. interests — like safeguarding Americans from nuclear blackmail by North Korea.”  On funding the military, Carafano added that while it is laudable that the president is forward-leaning in protecting American interests in places like the Middle East and Asia, he also noted the importance of ‘peace through strength.’ American strategy isn’t all about military action, but a strong military is foundational to a strong America and Trump is right to press Congress to fully fund the defense of the nation.”  Read the full address here . \n",

      "The U.S. campaign of drone strikes to kill militants in other countries is legal under international law, President Barack Obama’s counterterrorism adviser insisted on Monday in a rare public admission and justification of the controversial tactic. The US drone programme, operated by its spy agency, the Central Investigation Agency (CIA), has reportedly killed 2,200 people in Pakistan (August 2011 tally), including 168 children among at least 385 civilians and non-combatants. It has been a source of public anger and last month, in its US policy review, Pakistan decided to ask US to stop the attacks. White House counter terrorism adviser John Brennan said drone strikes are legal and ethical against al-Qaeda forces, which he described as “legitimate military targets” in armed conflict against the U.S. Marking the anniversary of the killing of al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces in Pakistan, Brennan said the strikes are used only in cases of a “significant threat.” “I’m here today because President Obama has instructed us to be more open with the American people about these efforts,” Brennan said in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a Washington think tank. “These targeted strikes are legal,” he said, citing legal opinions from the administration, the U.S. Constitution and the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the meantime some of the documents seized Navy SEALs at the bin Laden compound will be made public online this week by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, he said. In one, Brennan said, bin Laden expressed concern about “the rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced and this would lead to the repeat of mistakes.”‎   Post Views:  97\n",

      "Officials say, Supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan have resumed after protests over drone strikes blocked a key road in Pakistan for three days. US drone attacks have escalated in the region since President Barack Obama took office. More than 100 raids were reported last year. Due to the sit-in in the provincial capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), thousands of vehicles, which were carrying oil, food and other essential supplies for NATO forces were stooped on their way. More than 3,000 trucks carrying supplies from the Pakistani port of Karachi to the Afghan capital, Kabul, pass the northern route each day. During the two day sit-in, PTI Chariman, Imran Khan warned that all NATO supply routes across Pakistan will be blocked by the protesters if drone strikes are not stopped. Extra security was provided by the provincial governments at the parking sites where hundreds of tankers and containers were parked between Karachi and Peshawar at various places waiting for the resumption of their journey to Afghanistan, fortunately no incident of firing or burning of the tankers took place during these days. Although US troops use alternative routes through Central Asia, most supplies and equipment required by coalition troops in Afghanistan are shipped through Pakistan, Militants frequently target NATO oil supply tankers and set them ablaze. Public anger intensified after a March 17 drone attack killed more than 30 people including civilians.   Post Views:  113\n",

      "An influential Pakistani religious scholar who was once labeled as the ‘Father of Taliban’ has endorsed the war skills of the newly-appointed Taliban chief. The Afghan defense officials dismissed the skills endorsement by Sami-ul-Haq and said the Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada is neither a religious cleric nor he has skills in military. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Dawlat Waziri said Mullah Akhundzada would not kill the civilians if he was a military expert and had religious knowledge. Sami-ul-Haq warned that Afghanistan would see a surge in violence following the ascension of new Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah. “Those who think that Haibatullah is a mere cleric and a seminary preacher will soon bear witness to his skill as a militant commander,” he told Dawn after a Defence of Pakistan Council (DPC) meeting in the capital on Monday. He blamed the United States for the persistent violence and said “It was America that resorted to violence again; the assassination of Mullah Mansour is nothing short of murder.” Mullah Mansoor was killed in a drone strike in Balochistan province of Pakistan last month as he was travelling reportedly from Iran. The Taliban group announced the appointment of Mullah Akhundzada as its new chief shortly after the death of Mullah Mansoor was confirmed.   Post Views:  263\n",

      "The Pakistani officials on Friday announced the latest decision of the country’s decision regarding the expulsion of the hundreds of thousands of the Afghan refugees. The officials said the deadline for the stay of the Afghan refugees has been further extended until 30th of June this year. According to the officials, refugees possessing Proof of Registration cards could continue to stay in the country until June 30 and that the same policy would also be applicable on those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACCs). This comes as the Pakistani officials had earlier announced that the Afghan refugees currently residing in Pakistan should return to their homeland until the end of March. In the meantime, efforts are underway in Afghanistan to pave the way for the return of the Afghan refugees from the neighboring countries, specifically Pakistan which currently hosts hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees. Speaking during a gathering to mark the 29th year of the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan in mid-February, President Ghani said the government is committed to bring changes in its priorities in a bid to pave the way for the return of the refugees. President Ghani further added that he wants all the refugees to return to the country in the next 24 months, insisting that the government does not want the issue of the refugees remain an excuse for the Pakistani authorities. President Ghani made the remarks in reaction to Pakistani officials’ remarks regarding the misuse of the refugees by the terror outfits. The foreign ministry of Pakistan in reaction to a drone strike on Haqqani terrorist network member said in January that “Pakistan has also been stressing the need of early repatriation of Afghan refugees as their presence in Pakistan helps Afghan terrorists to melt and morph among them.” The Minister of Interior of Pakistan Ahsan Iqbal had earlier said that the return of Afghan refugees is prerequisite to deny safe havens to the Afghan militants. Iqbal told reporters that around three million refugees still reside in Pakistan emphasizing that no one should expect that the country would be able to certify those involved in the cross-border terrorist activities. According to Iqbal, Pakistan cold only guarantee having no terrorists on its soil when all refugees return to their homeland.   Post Views:  149\n",

      "AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army, aided by Russian warplanes, attacked rebel-held towns in northwestern Syria on Wednesday in the most extensive bombardment in weeks against the last remaining rebel bastion in the country, rebels, rescuers and residents said. Rebels who have fought to topple President Bashar al-Assad for eight years are now largely confined to the enclave in the northwest near the Turkish border. Around four million people now live there, including hundreds of thousands of opponents of Assad who fled there from other parts of the country. The enclave is protected by a “de-escalation zone” agreement brokered last year by Assad’s main international backers Russia and Iran, and Turkey which has supported the rebels in the past and has sent troops to monitor the truce. Residents said at least 12 aerial raids had hit Idlib city, including a civilian prison on its outskirts, where they said dozens of prisoners escaped. At least four civilians were killed. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed it had hit Idlib in coordination with Turkey, targeting drones and weapons stores of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) jihadists it said were intended for use in an attack on a major Russian air base near the Mediterranean coast. [R4N20O02O] The Syrian army has escalated its shelling of the enclave since early February. The attacks have killed dozens of civilians and injured hundreds, and led to tens of thousands of people fleeing frontline areas to camps and towns closer to the Turkish border, rescuers and aid agencies said. The Syrian army denies targeting civilians and says the army is responding to stepped-up attacks staged by al Qaeda-inspired fighters who aim to wreck the truce and control the area. Residents along the border area with Turkey could hear heavy overnight aerial strikes that covered a wide stretch of territory from rebel-held areas near government-held Latakia province on the Mediterranean to Idlib city towards the east and extending to adjoining opposition-held parts of northern Hama. “They burnt the land... The sounds were heard very clearly,” said Ibrahim al Sheikh, a father of five in the border town of Atmeh. He quoted relatives as saying the shelling was the heaviest yet in the two weeks of escalation. The escalation in the northwest is taking place as a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led militia has launched a separate assault on the final bastion of Islamic State fighters on the opposite, eastern end of the country, creating turning points on both major fronts of Syria’s multi-sided civil war. ‘WHOEVER DID THIS IS A BEAST’ In the northwest, residents said white phosphorous munitions were fired overnight on the town of al Tamana in northwestern Idlib countryside, where rescue workers on Wednesday said they put out several fires caused by more than 80 rocket strikes. Among the targets of the aerial campaign was a makeshift tent camp in Kfr Amim, east of Idlib city, that shelters displaced families, where two women were killed and at least 10 children injured when bombs landed after midnight. “Whoever did this is a beast, truly a beast. It’s a camp with only women and children. There is nothing we can say except that this Russian beast is coming to kill,” said Laith al Abdullah, a civil defence worker in Sarqeb town who helped in the rescue effort, reached by mobile phone. Rocket shelling from a major army base in Joreen, in Hama province, escalated a week-long bombardment of rural areas near the town of Jisr al Shaqour, said Ahmed Abdul Salam, a rebel commander in the Turkey-backed National Liberation Front. A Russian army base, south of government-controlled Halafaya town, also targeted Kafr Zeita in northern Hama countryside while cluster bombs hit several rebel-held towns in southern Idlib, rebels said. The stepped-up bombardment has depopulated opposition-held towns in the buffer zone that straddles parts of Idlib to northern Hama and parts of Latakia province. The opposition-held city of Khan Sheikhon had become a ghost city with most of its more than 70,000 people fleeing, said Yousef al Idlibi, a former resident who moved to Idlib city. Turkey, which began patrols in the buffer zone on Friday, has condemned what it said were increasing provocations to wreck the truce, and warned that a bombing campaign by the Russians and the Syrian army would cause a major humanitarian crisis. Many residents are exasperated by the failure of Turkish forces to respond to the bombardments. The Syrian army has called for Turkish forces to withdraw.

      " JERUSALEM — The Israeli military on Thursday said it attacked nearly all of Iran’s military installations in neighboring Syria in response to an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights, in the most serious military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date.  Israel said the targets of the strikes, its largest in Syria since the 1973 war, included weapons storage, logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria. It also said it destroyed several Syrian air-defense systems after coming under heavy fire and that none of its warplanes were hit.  Iranian media described the attacks as “unprecedented,” but there was no official Iranian comment on Israel’s claims.  Israel has acknowledged carrying out over 100 airstrikes in neighboring Syria since the civil war erupted in 2011, most believed to be aimed at suspected Iranian weapons shipments bound for the Hezbollah militant group.  But in the past few weeks, Israel has shifted to a more direct and public confrontation with Iran, striking at Iranian bases, weapons depots and rocket launchers across Syria, and killing Iranian troops. Israel accuses Tehran of seeking to establish a foothold on its doorstep. Iran has vowed to retaliate.  Reflecting the scope of the overnight attacks, Russia’s military said 28 Israeli jets were involved, striking at several Iranian and government sites in Syria with 70 missiles. It said half of the missiles were shot down.  Speaking at the Herzliya Conference, an annual security gathering north of Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel would response fiercely to any further Iranian actions.  “We will not let Iran turn Syria into a forward base against Israel,” he said. “We, of course, struck almost all the Iranian infrastructure in Syria, and they need to remember this arrogance of theirs. If we get rain, they’ll get a flood. I hope that we ended this chapter and that everyone understood.”  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which closely monitors the civil war through sources inside Syria, said the overnight Israeli attacks struck several military posts for Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias near the capital, Damascus, in central Syria and in southern Syria. The Observatory said the attacks killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers. It said it was not immediately clear if Iranians were among those killed.  An Iranian state television presenter announced the Israeli strikes, sourcing the information to Syria’s state-run SANA news agency. The broadcaster described the Israeli attack as “unprecedented” since the 1967 Mideast war.  An Israeli tank can be seen near the Israeli side of the border with Syria in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israel. Photo by Amir Cohen/Reuters  Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, annexing it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally. In 1974, Israel and Syria reached a cease-fire and a disengagement deal that froze the conflict lines with the plateau in Israeli hands.  Damascus shook with sounds of explosions just before dawn, and firing by Syrian air defenses over the city was heard for more than five hours. Syria’s state news agency SANA said Israeli missiles hit air defense positions, radar stations and a weapons warehouse, but claimed most incoming rockets were intercepted.  Russia sent forces to Syria to back President Bashar Assad in 2015. But Israel and Russia have maintained close communications to prevent their air forces from coming into conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Moscow on Wednesday to meet with President Vladimir Putin and discuss military coordination in Syria.  Israel said early Thursday that Iran’s Quds Force fired 20 rockets at Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said four of the rockets were intercepted, while the others fell short of their targets. The incoming attack set off air raid sirens in the Golan.  Conricus said Israel was not looking to escalate the situation but that troops will continue to be on “very high alert.”  “Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,” he said.  It is believed to be the first time in decades that such firepower from Syria has been directed at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights.  Iran’s ability to hit back further could be limited. Its resources in Syria pale in comparison to the high-tech Israeli military and it could also be wary of military entanglement at a time when it is trying to salvage the international nuclear deal.  Iran has sent thousands of troops to back Assad, and Israel fears that as the fighting nears an end, Iran and tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen will turn their focus to Israel.  Earlier this week, Syrian state media said Israel struck a military outpost near Damascus. The Observatory said the missiles targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, killing at least 15 people, eight of them Iranians.  Last month, an attack on Syria’s T4 air base in the central Homs province killed seven Iranian military personnel. On April 30, Israel was said to have struck government outposts in northern Syria, killing more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians.  Israel considers Iran to be its most bitter enemy, citing Iran’s hostile rhetoric, support for anti-Israel militant groups and development of long-range missiles. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, with strong support from Israel, has further raised tensions.  Israel and Iran have appeared to be on a collision course for months.  In February, Israel shot down what it said was an armed Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace. Israel responded by attacking anti-aircraft positions in Syria, and an Israeli warplane was shot down during the battle.  But Thursday was the first time Israel openly acknowledged targeting Iran.

      "LA MALBAIE: US President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would know within a minute whether something good will come of his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore, which he described as a  “mission of peace.”  “I think within the first minute I’ll know. Just my touch, my feel. That’s what I do,” Trump told reporters at a news conference at the G7 summit in Quebec.  “And if I think it won’t happen — I’m not going to waste my time. I don’t want to waste his time.”  The main issue for the June 12 summit in Singapore is the US demand for North Korea to abandon a nuclear weapons programme that now threatens the United States.  “I have a clear objective, but I have to say — it’s going to be something that will always be spur of the moment,” Trump said.  “You don’t know. This has not been done before at this level. This is a leader who really is an unknown personality.”  North Korea has rejected giving up its arsenal unilaterally and defends its nuclear and missile programs as a deterrent against what it sees as US aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean War.  “I feel really confident. It’s never been done, it’s never been tested,” said Trump.  “So we are going in with a really positive spirit.”  Published in Dawn, June 10th, 2018 \n",

      " JERUSALEM — The Israeli military lifted its restrictions along the Gaza border Sunday, indicating it had accepted an Egypt-mediated cease-fire that ended a 24-hour round of fighting with Hamas militants that had threatened to devolve into all-out war.  The military had shut down a popular beach and placed limitations on large gatherings as residents kept mostly close to home on Saturday amid dozens of rockets that were fired from Gaza. But after several hours of calm it said residents could resume their daily routines.  On Saturday, the military carried out its largest wave of airstrikes in Gaza since the 2014 war, hitting several Hamas military compounds and flattening a number of its training camps. Two Palestinian teenagers were killed in an airstrike in Gaza City, while four Israelis were wounded from a rocket that landed on a residential home.

Photo by Suhaib Salem/Reuters  The military said several mortar shells were fired even after Hamas announced the cease-fire as sirens warning of incoming projectiles wailed in Israel overnight again. The military struck the mortar launcher early Sunday but the calm held, with neither side appearing eager to resume hostilities.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not accept a cease-fire unless it included an end to all militant hostilities, including incendiary kites and balloons from Gaza that have devastated nearby Israeli farmlands and nature reserves.  “The Israeli military has delivered its most punishing blow against Hamas since the 2014 war. I hope they got the message. If not, they will get it later on,” he said at the weekly cabinet meeting.  After several balloons drifted into Israel Sunday, the military said it targeted the Hamas squad that had launched them from the northern Gaza Strip.

Photo by Mohammed Salem/Reuters  Hamas police also announced an explosion Sunday at a house in Gaza City that killed a father and son, aged 35 and 13. The explosion appeared to be an accidental blast related to militant stock piles of explosives. Hamas said it would investigate.  Israel said it unleashed Saturday’s barrage in response to weeks of violence along Gaza’s border — including a grenade attack Friday that wounded an officer — as well as sustained Hamas rocket attacks and a campaign of incendiary devices floating over the border.  Hamas responded with more than 200 projectiles toward Israel communities, evoking memories of the three wars the sides have waged over the past decade. Israel said its Iron Dome defense system shot down more than 20 projectiles.  Israel also destroyed several Hamas attack tunnels, as well as factories involved in the production of the incendiary kites and balloons, and a Hamas battalion headquarters in northern Gaza.  “We have no intention of tolerating rockets, kites, drones or anything,” said Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. “I hope that Hamas will draw conclusions and if not, they will have to pay a heavy price.”  A Palestinian man looks at a building that was destroyed by Israeli air strikes in Gaza City July 15, 2018. Photo by Suhaib Salem/Reuters  Two teenagers were killed and several others were wounded when Israel struck an unfinished five-story building near a Hamas security compound and a public park in Gaza City, reducing the structure to rubble. The military said Hamas was using it as a training facility and had dug a tunnel underneath as part of its underground network.  The rare strike in the heart of Gaza City blew out windows at a nearby mosque, an art gallery, government offices, a tech start-up company and dozens of houses, leaving light fixtures and wiring dangling. The Al-Azhar university said its classrooms and the dentistry college lab were also damaged.  Speaking to thousands attending the two teenagers’ funeral, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh vowed to continue Gaza protests and to take revenge for the teens. He also met with the U.N. Mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, who urged both sides to maintain calm  “Yesterday we were on the brink of war, and it has taken the concerted efforts of everyone to make sure that we step back from confrontation,” Mladenov said in Gaza. “Everybody needs to take a step back.”  The strike that killed the teenagers unleashed a Hamas’ launch toward the Israeli border town of Sderot, where a rocket hit the Buchris family home.  “We were sitting in the living room and all of a sudden, the aquarium exploded and there was smoke everywhere and glass flew everywhere,” said Aharon Buchris, who was wounded along with his wife and two teenage daughters, as he awaited surgery in hospital.  Israel has been warning Hamas that while it has no interest in exacerbating hostilities, it will not tolerate Gaza militants’ continued efforts to breach the border and its campaign of incendiary attacks on Israeli border communities.  Hamas-led border protests are aimed in part at drawing attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. Over 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since protests began on March 30.  With Israel focused on efforts to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military foothold in neighboring Syria, it has been wary of escalating violence in Gaza. Netanyahu has also come under pressure from southern Israeli communities under rocket fire from Gaza.  Hamas, meanwhile, has been trying to break out of its isolation and spotlight the hardships of the impoverished strip without invoking the full wrath of Israel.

      "According to reports, the probe team which was appointed by president Hamid Karzai to investigate the civilian casualties in a US airstrike in Parwan province of Afghanistan, has presented false evidences regarding the civilian deaths in the raid. The probe delegation headed by Afghan parliament member Abdul Satar Khawasi, who had called on the residents of Ghorband district for Jihad against the US forces. An examination of the dossier which contains images and videos, has revealed that the probe team falsely represented at least some of the evidence in the dossier, and distributed other material whose provenance, at best, could not be determined, the New York Times reported. The examination of the documents has further revealed that much of the same material was posted on a Taliban website last week, a rare instance of the militant group’s political speech matching that of the government it is fighting to topple. According to the New York Times, at least two of the images distributed in the dossier could not have shown casualties from airstrike, as one image was taken at the funeral of victims of a NATO airstrike in northern Afghanistan in 2009, and the second photo shows the bodies of two boys wrapped in burial shrouds, and has been used for years on websites assailing civilian deaths in American drone strikes in Pakistan. The probe team had claimed at least 12 civilians including women and children were killed in the airstrike conducted by NATO forces in Siah Gerd district of Parwan province. However, Parwan governor, Abdul Basir Salangi also denied the findings of the probe team and said the death toll was in the single digits and those claiming higher deaths tolls were “supporters of the Taliban.” Mr. Salangi further added that no members of the commission seemed to have visited the area, and the interviews and photographs along with the video were prepared by driver of Khawasi and his bodyguard.

      "US Ambassador to Pakistan, Richard Olson, has said drone strikes in Pakistan would continue until terror havens in the tribal areas of the country are eliminated. This comes as US Central Intelligence Agency will be allowed to continue its campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan for a year or more under a new detailed counter-terrorism manual, Washington Post reported. The classified manual, called a counterterrorism “playbook,” sets out stringent rules with regard to US targeted killings, but it incorporates a carve-out that would allow the CIA to continue bombing suspected militants in Pakistan for “less than two years but more than one.” According to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between 2,627 and 3,457 people have been reportedly killed by US drones in Pakistan since 2004, including between 475 and nearly 900 civilians. The covert strikes are publicly criticised by the Pakistani government as a violation of sovereignty but American officials believe they are a vital weapon in the war against militants. Granting the CIA a temporary exemption for its Pakistan operations was described by officials cited by the Post as a “compromise that allowed officials to move forward with other parts of the playbook”. The Post said the adoption of a formal guide to targeted killing marks a significant milestone: the institutionalisation of a practice that would have seemed anathema to many before the September 11, 2001 attacks.

      "The NATO-led Resolute Support (RS) mission in Afghanistan rejected claims by the loyalists of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist group regarding the alleged killing of a US military commander in Kabul. “There is no truth to any claims that a U.S. military commander was killed in today’s #Kabul explosion, several ANA members were wounded only,” the alliance said. An explosion took place in the vicinity of Makroryan area of the city earlier today which is located close to the US Embassy in Kabul with the security officials saying only three civilians were wounded. However, ISIS loyalists released a statement on the Amaq news agency saying that they had killed the US commander and two Afghan army colonels using a ‘sticky bomb’. The loyalists of the terror group claimed it happened outside the US embassy in the Afghan capital in Masoud Square. The latest claim by the loyalists of the terror group come as the Afghan and US forces have stepped up raids gainst them in eastern Nangarhar province where they have been widely conducting insurgency activities. The leader of the terror group Hafeez Saeed Khan was killed in a US drone strike in Nangarhar province late in the month of July.   Post Views:  183\n",

      " KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban tried to overrun a provincial capital in Afghanistan early on Friday, hiding inside homes before slipping into city streets in the night to attack security forces and killing at least 14 policemen before being pushed back, officials said.  The overnight attack in the southeastern city of Ghazni, the capital of a province with the same name, also wounded at least 20 members of the security forces, said Baz Mohammad Hemat, the administrator of the Ghazni city hospital.  The city was in lockdown and fighting continued throughout the day Friday, with sporadic bursts of gunfire from Taliban fighters who had hunkered down in elevated positions inside Ghazni from which they were shooting, some residents said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear for their safety.  An Afghan military helicopter crash landed in the city during the daytime fighting, and four Afghan soldiers on board were injured, one critically, said Mohammad Radmanish, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.      The brazen assaults by the Taliban, who have been gaining more ground in their annual spring offensive and who have shrugged off the government’s latest offers of a cease-fire and negotiations, underscore the difficulties Afghan forces face in battling the relentless insurgency on their own in efforts to end the nearly 17-year war.   The Taliban claimed they had downed the “enemy” helicopter in Ghazni but Radmanish said it was not immediately clear if the helicopter had been hit or crash landed due to other reasons.  Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a Taliban attack Thursday night in western Herat province left six policemen dead in the district of Obe, said the governor’s spokesman there, Gelani Farhad.  The brazen assaults by the Taliban, who have been gaining more ground in their annual spring offensive and who have shrugged off the government’s latest offers of a cease-fire and negotiations, underscore the difficulties Afghan forces face in battling the relentless insurgency on their own in efforts to end the nearly 17-year war.  The Ghazni attack began around 2 a.m. with intense gunbattles raging and fires burning in several shops in the city’s residential areas, provincial police chief Farid Ahmad Mashal told The Associated Press.  After repulsing the first assault, police conducted house-to-house searches for remaining Taliban fighters. Also, an investigation was underway to determine how the insurgents managed to infiltrate so deep into the city, barely 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of the Afghan capital of Kabul.  Hemat, the hospital administrator, said two wounded civilians were brought to the hospital. He was worried more wounded could be out there as the city was shut down and ambulances were not being sent out.  Mashal said there were more than 100 other casualties but he could not give a breakdown of the dead and wounded. Most of the casualties were Taliban, he said.  Several bodies of dead Taliban fighters remained on the streets of Ghazni, the police chief said. In one location, bodies of 39 Taliban fighters were recovered from under a bridge on the southern edge of the city.  Airstrikes called in to quash the offensive also killed dozens of Taliban, Mashal said.      The insurgents have stepped up attacks across the country since NATO and the United States formally ended their combat mission in 2014, and have seized control of several districts.   Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said American forces and U.S. attack helicopters had assisted Afghan troops in pushing back the Taliban during the night’s multiple attacks in Ghazni.  “U.S. forces responded with close-air support and conducted one drone strike,” O’Donnell said.  By midday Friday, O’Donnell said fighting continued inside Ghazni, prompting the U.S. forces to return American attack helicopters and fighter jets to the area after they were initially pulled back.  “It is a show of presence,” he said.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed that parts of Ghazni had been seized and that Taliban fighters had killed scores of people. He also told the AP over the phone that Taliban anti-aircraft fire downed the Afghan army helicopter.  Mujahid did not comment on the Herat attack that killed six policemen at a district checkpoint.  After dawn Friday, Ghazni’s residents were staying indoors and all shops in the city remained closed. The road from Kabul to Afghanistan’s southern provinces was also closed because it runs through Ghazni.  The insurgents have stepped up attacks across the country since NATO and the United States formally ended their combat mission in 2014, and have seized control of several districts. U.S. and NATO forces remain in Afghanistan mainly in a supporting and training role.  Separately from the Taliban, an Islamic State affiliate has also carried out dozens of deadly attacks in recent years, mainly targeting security forces and minority Shiites.  ___  Associated Press writers Kathy Gannon in Islamabad and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report. \n",

      " WASHINGTON — One U.S. special operations soldier was killed and four U.S. service members wounded in an “enemy attack” Friday in Somalia, the U.S. military said — casualties that are likely to put renewed scrutiny on America’s counterterror operations in Africa.  It’s the first public announcement of a U.S. military combat death on the continent since four U.S. service members were killed in a militant ambush in the west African nation of Niger in October.  President Donald Trump paid tribute on Twitter Friday night, offering “thoughts and prayers” to the families of the soldier who was killed and those who were wounded. “They are truly all HEROES,” he tweeted.  U.S. Africa Command said in a statement that U.S. troops with Somali and Kenyan forces came under mortar and small-arms fire in Jubaland, Somalia, at around 2.45 p.m. local time.  One member of the “partner forces” was wounded. One of the wounded U.S. service members received sufficient medical care in the field, and the other three were medically evacuated for additional treatment.  The statement did not identify the attackers but said a larger force of about 800 Somali and Kenyan troops were conducting a multi-day operation against al-Shabab militants about 350 kilometers (217 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred. The operation aimed to clear the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab from contested areas. The U.S. provided advice, assistance and aerial surveillance during the mission, the statement said.  Al-Shabab claimed credit for the attack, the SITE Intelligence Group said in a statement Friday.  The U.S. has about 1,000 special operations personnel in Africa. The last killing of a U.S. service member in Somalia was in May 2017 during an operation about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Mogadishu.  Myeshia Johnson, wife of U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson, who was among four special forces soldiers killed in Niger, kisses his coffin at a graveside service in Hollywood, Florida, October 21, 2017.  Photo by Reuters.  The U.S. had pulled out of the Horn of Africa nation after 1993, when two helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu and bodies of Americans were dragged through the streets.  But Trump in early 2017 approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, leading to an increase in U.S. military personnel to more than 500 and the launch of dozens of drone strikes. Al-Shabab has been blamed for the October truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 500 people.  Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaida, seeks to establish an Islamic state in Somalia. It was pushed out of Mogadishu in recent years but continues to control rural areas in the south and central regions. Its fighters continue to attack the bases of a multinational African Union force that remains largely responsible for security as Somalia’s fragile central government tries to recover from decades of chaos.  The U.S. military and others have expressed concern about the 21,000-strong AU force’s plan to withdraw by 2020 and hand over security responsibilities to Somali forces, saying the local troops are not ready.  Late last year U.S. drone strikes also began targeting a small presence of fighters linked to the Islamic State group in Somalia’s north.  Somali officials have said civilians have been killed in more than one joint U.S. military operation with Somali forces. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Africa Command issued a statement in response to allegations that civilians had been killed in a May 9 operation, saying a “thorough review” found the allegations to be “not credible.”  The October attack in Niger raised questions in Washington about the U.S. military presence across Africa as the Trump administration focuses counterterror efforts on a range of groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.  A Pentagon investigation into the Niger attack, parts of which were made public last month, found multiple failures but none that directly caused the ambush by Islamic State group-linked fighters.  The investigation has already triggered changes in the way military activities are carried out in Niger and elsewhere in Africa, including giving teams the option to use heavily armored vehicles and beefed-up firepower.  ____  Anna contributed from Johannesburg, South Africa. \n",

      "(Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties have failed to leave the main port city of Hodeidah three months after agreeing to a breakthrough U.N.-led truce deal as part of efforts to end a four-year-old war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine. The following is a timeline of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country’s slide into violence and how the conflict has developed. - 1990. Unification of north and south Yemen to form a single state under president Ali Abdullah Saleh. - 1994. Civil war in which Saleh prevents south, angered by what it sees as its lower status, from splitting with north. - 2003-09. Houthi group in north protests marginalisation of the local Zaydi Shi’ite Muslim sect and fights six wars with Saleh’s forces and one with Saudi Arabia. - 2011. Arab Spring protests undermine Saleh’s rule, lead to splits in the army and allow al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to seize swathes of territory in the east. - 2012. Saleh steps down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi becomes interim president and oversees a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. - 2013. AQAP survives military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. Saleh and his allies undermine the political transition. - 2014. The Houthis rapidly advance south from Saadeh and seize Sanaa on September 21 with help from Saleh. They demand a share in power. - 2015. Hadi tries to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Iran-aligned Houthis and Saleh, who arrest him. He escapes, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later the coalition, aiming to restore Hadi’s ousted government, drives the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidify, setting up years of stalemate. - 2016. AQAP takes advantage of the chaos to establish a mini-state around Mukalla in east Yemen, raising fears the war will lead to a new surge in jihadist activity. The UAE backs local forces in a battle that ends the group’s rule there. Hunger grows as the coalition imposes a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports, something it denies. Coalition air strikes that kill civilians prompt warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continues. - 2017. The Houthis launch a growing number of missiles deep into Saudi Arabia, including at Riyadh. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by reneging on his Houthi allies, Saleh switches sides, but is killed trying to escape them. Friction also develops between fighters in Aden backed by Saudi Arabia, and those backed by its Emirati coalition partners. - 2018. Coalition-backed forces, including some flying the southern separatist flag, advance up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. Hodeidah handles the bulk of Yemen’s commercial and aid imports and is critical for feeding the population of 30 million. Military stalemate ensues: the Houthis control the port and coalition-backed Yemeni forces mass on the outskirts. In the first major breakthrough in peace efforts, the warring parties agree at December talks in Sweden, the first in two years, on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah. Work on a prisoner swap also begins. -2019. The Stockholm Hodeidah truce largely holds but the withdrawal has yet to materialize amid deep mistrust between the Houthi movement, which controls Hodeidah, and the Saudi-led coalition massed on its outskirts. Violence continues in parts of Yemen outside Hodeidah.

      " TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military confirmed on Wednesday it carried out the 2007 airstrike in Syria that destroyed what was believed to be a nuclear reactor, lifting the veil of secrecy over one of its most daring and mysterious operations in recent memory.  Although Israel was widely believed to have been behind the Sept. 6, 2007, airstrike, it has never before commented publicly on it.  In a lengthy release, the military revealed that eight F-15 fighter jets carried out the top-secret airstrikes against the facility in the Deir el-Zour region, 450 kilometers (about 300 miles) northeast of Damascus, destroying a site that had been in development for years and was scheduled to go into operation at the end of that year.  Israel’s involvement has been one of its most closely held secrets, and it was not immediately clear why Israel decided to go public now. The military would not comment on its reasoning, but the move could be related to the upcoming memoir of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike and has hinted about it for years. It could also be meant as a warning to archenemy Iran, which is deeply involved in Syria’s conflict.  “The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the Israeli military,” Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Wednesday. “Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalize this equation.”  Israel and Syria have always been bitter enemies . Throughout Syria’s seven-year civil war, Israel has carried out well over 100 airstrikes, most believed to have been aimed at suspected weapons shipments destined for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group. Both Iran and Hezbollah are allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad.  At the time of the 2007 strike, Syria accused Israel of invading its airspace, but gave no further details about the target.      Israel’s involvement has been one of its most closely held secrets, and it was not immediately clear why Israel decided to go public now.   The pre-mission briefing, made public Wednesday, stated that the operation should not be attributed to Israel so as to minimize the potential for an all-out war.  The Syria strike was reminiscent of an Israeli attack in 1981 against a reactor being built in Iraq. That strike was later credited with preventing Saddam Hussein from acquiring weapons of mass destruction that could have been used in the Gulf War a decade later.  “The message from the 2007 attack on the reactor is that Israel will not tolerate construction that can pose an existential threat,” military chief Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot said in Wednesday’s statement. “This was the message in 1981, this is the message in 2007 and this is the future message to our enemies.”  Eisenkot, who at the time commanded Israel’s northern front along the Lebanese and Syrian borders, said it marked Israel’s most comprehensive attack in Syria since the 1973 Mideast war, and that everyone involved knew it could spark a new one. He said only a handful of top commanders were aware of the plans for Operation “Outside The Box.”  The military said the F-15s took off from two bases in southern Israel at 10:30 p.m. on Sept. 5, and returned four hours later.  Wednesday’s announcement also indicated the Syrian reactor was much closer to completion than previously reported.  From Israel’s perspective, the strike was an astounding success since it not only destroyed the site, but prevented further escalation and strengthened its deterrence in the region.  A screen grab from a video of an undated material released by the Israeli military on March 21, 2018 shows a debris seen on the site after what the military describes is an Israeli air strike on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site near Deir al-Zor on Sept. 6, 2007. Photo by IDF/Handout via Reuters  Air force commander Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin said the current turmoil in Syria has further vindicated the strike, particularly since the reactor was in an area later captured by Islamic State militants.  “Imagine what situation we would be in today if there was a nuclear reactor in Syria,” Norkin said. “Israel’s decision to destroy the reactor is one of the most important decisions taken here in the last 70 years.”  Uzi Rabi, an expert on Iran at Tel Aviv University, said Israel’s surprising confirmation might be meant as a “warning sign” to Iran as it expands its military footprint in Syria. Israel has warned against the establishment of a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria, particularly in areas close to Israel.  Tzipi Livni, who was foreign minister at the time of the strike, told The Associated Press that in discussions after Israel discovered the reactor, “we asked ourselves whether Israel can, or is, willing to live with this.”  “The answer was ‘no’ then, the answer is ‘no’ now,” she said.  Last month, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Israel responded by bombing Syrian anti-aircraft batteries.  In Wednesday’s statement, the military said it began obtaining information regarding foreign experts helping Syria develop the Deir el-Zour site in late 2004. Later, it discovered that North Korea was helping Syria build a reactor to manufacture plutonium.  In his memoir, “Decision Points,” former President George W. Bush said Israel first asked the United States to bomb the site, and then carried out an attack itself when Washington declined.  The strike came about a year after Israel’s inconclusive war against Hezbollah, in which the Lebanese guerrillas battled Israel’s army to a stalemate. The poor performance raised questions about Israel’s deterrent capabilities.  “Prime Minister Olmert’s execution of the strike made up for the confidence I had lost in the Israelis during the Lebanon war,” Bush wrote, adding that the Israeli leader rejected a suggestion to go public with the operation.  “Olmert told me he wanted total secrecy. He wanted to avoid anything that might back Syria into a corner and force Assad to retaliate. This was his operation, and I felt an obligation to respect his wishes,” Bush wrote.  Olmert has skirted around the issue, and military censors, for years, repeatedly saying that according to foreign sources Israel had been involved. After Bush’s account was published in 2010, Olmert said: “I don’t want (to), and I can’t deny it.”  Olmert, who was prime minister from 2006 until 2009 and was recently released from prison after serving time for corruption, is expected to delve more deeply into the issue in his upcoming book. The disclosure looks to help rehabilitate at least part of Olmert’s tarnished image while damaging the legacy of his longtime rival, then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who was reportedly hesitant to strike in Syria. \n",

      "ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey gave a guarded welcome on Wednesday to a U.S. decision to offer millions of dollars to help capture three top Kurdish PKK militants but said Washington must also break its alliance with Kurdish militias in northern Syria. FILE PHOTO: U.S. special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey (R) attends a meeting at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, September 14, 2018. Xu Jinquan/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Washington pledged up to $5 million for information which could lead to the arrest of PKK military commander Murat Karayilan, and lesser rewards for two other leaders of the group  which has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 34 years. The surprise move followed a series of steps in the last month which have eased a diplomatic crisis between the two NATO allies. However they remain deeply divided, including over U.S. support for Kurdish YPG fighters in north Syria. Turkey says the YPG is indistinguishable from the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara, Washington and the European Union, and demands the United States stop support for the militia - a U.S. ally against Islamic State in Syria. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said the U.S. rewards offer was a positive but “very, very late” step, and called on Washington to adopt the same policy to the YPG as it did to the PKK. “It is not possible for us to accept putting a bounty on PKK leaders on the one hand, and sending trucks of tools, weapons and ammunition to the YPG on the other,” he told state-owned Anadolu news agency. Turkey’s foreign ministry also said it expected the United States to support the announcement with concrete action in Syria and Iraq “against the PKK and its extensions”. Turkey has regularly launched cross-border strikes into northern Iraq, targeting what it says are PKK bases near the group’s Qandil mountains stronghold. In Syria, where Turkey has conducted two military incursions into the northwest since 2016, President Tayyip Erdogan has also threatened to extend operations in northeastern border regions where YPG forces operate. He issued a “final warning” two weeks ago to anyone he said was endangering Turkey’s border. THREAT TO TURKEY More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched its insurgency in Turkey in 1984. Turkish defence analyst Can Kasapoglu said the U.S. move suggested Washington had started to see that the presence of the Kurdish militia in Syria was a national security threat “to the extent of survival for Turkey”. However, the United States would expect something in return from Turkey, he said, despite Ankara’s rejection of any step that would legitimise the YPG. Washington’s special representative for Syria told reporters that the United States understood Turkish concerns about links between the PKK and YPG. “We are at pains to reassure Turkey that we will do everything we can that there is ... no concrete security threat coming out of the north against Turkey,” James Jeffrey said. Jeffrey said the United States was limiting “very very carefully” the weapons it was giving to the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces battling Islamic State militants. “We give them only light weapons. That’s one reason why they have not been as successful recently against Daesh (Islamic State) as they have been in the past. They do not have tanks, they do not have artillery, we do not give them such heavy weapons.” FILE PHOTO: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his AK Party (AKP) in Ankara, Turkey, October 23, 2018. REUTERS/Tumay Berkin/File Photo Strained ties between Turkey and the United States have eased slightly in the last month. The two countries lifted mutual sanctions against top officials after a Turkish court freed a U.S. evangelical pastor in October. Washington announced this week that Turkey would receive a temporary waiver from oil sanctions reimposed on Iran, and Erdogan said talks on a possible U.S. fine against state-owned Halkbank over allegations of Iran sanctions evasion were on a positive track. U.S. and Turkish troops last week began joint patrols in northern Syria’s Manbij area after months of delay, and U.S. President Donald Trump and Erdogan are to meet this weekend at a summit in Paris.

      " GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Hamas and other militant groups said Tuesday they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire to end two days of intense fighting with Israel that had pushed the sworn enemies to the brink of a new war.  The sudden announcement brought relief to a region that had been paralyzed by hundreds of Palestinian rocket attacks in southern Israel and scores of Israeli airstrikes on targets in the Gaza Strip. But it did not address the deeper issues that pushed Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers toward their latest violence and left doubts about international efforts to forge a broader truce agreement.  Those efforts had appeared to be making progress in recent days as Israel allowed Qatar to deliver financial aid to the cash-strapped Hamas government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he wanted to avert an “unnecessary” war in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, had scaled back its mass protests that have led to weekly bloodshed along the Israeli border.      Tuesday’s cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas’ vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.   But hours after Netanyahu spoke Sunday, an Israeli commando unit on an undercover mission was caught behind enemy lines in Gaza by Hamas militants. Their discovery set off a battle that led to the deaths of seven militants and an Israeli officer, and triggered the heaviest barrage of rocket fire since a 2014 war.  The Israeli military said that Palestinian militants fired 460 rockets and mortars into Israel in a 24-hour period, while it carried out airstrikes on 160 targets in Gaza. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, and 26 people were wounded. In Israel, a 48-year-old Palestinian laborer was killed in a rocket strike on an apartment building where he was staying. Nearly 30 people were wounded, three critically.  With air raid sirens wailing throughout southern Israel and the explosions of airstrikes thundering in Gaza, the sides had appeared to be headed to what would have been their fourth war in a decade.  But late Tuesday, Hamas and other military groups issued a joint statement saying they had accepted an Egyptian cease-fire.  Terms of the deal appeared to be modest. Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group, said each side would promise quiet in exchange for quiet.  “It’s a mutual commitment to the cease-fire,” he said. “From our side, we responded positively to the Egyptian endeavor on the condition that the occupation does the same.”  The announcement set off celebrations in Gaza City as Hamas supporters declared victory.  At a demonstration staged in the rubble of Hamas’ TV station, demolished by an Israeli airstrike, crowds chanted the name of Hamas’ military wing. Shops reopened and cars jammed the streets. Israeli reconnaissance drones continued to buzz overhead.  Ismail Radwan, a Hamas official, expressed Hamas’ commitment to the cease-fire but warned that “our hands are on the trigger” if Israel violates the agreement.  In Israel, officials had no comment on the cease-fire claim even as dozens of protesters in the rocket-battered town of Sderot chanted “Disgrace!” at what they saw as the government’s capitulation to militant violence. But after nightfall, both the rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes had stopped.  KHAN YUNIS, GAZA – NOVEMBER 12: Funeral ceremony for seven Palestinians, including a military commander of Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas movement, held after they were killed in Israeli attack in Khan Yunis, Gaza on November 12, 2018. (Photo by Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)  The announcement came shortly after Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion on the rising tensions in Gaza.  The Cabinet said it had ordered the military to “continue operations as needed.” Israel’s Channel 10 TV reported deep divisions among the participants, with several hard-line ministers reportedly opposed to another cease-fire with Hamas.  Hamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel’s existence, seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Israel and Egypt immediately imposed a blockade on Gaza to contain Hamas. The blockade has ravaged Gaza’s economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants reject.  The standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control. Netanyahu’s apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.  Israel Ziv, a retired general who once commanded the Israeli military’s Gaza division, said Netanyahu was running out of options for dealing with Hamas.  “Either we come to a settlement or there’s an all-out campaign. Nothing in the middle is going to make a difference,” he said.  Tuesday’s cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas’ vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.      Netanyahu’s apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.   U.N. and Egyptian mediators had been making progress in recent weeks toward informal understandings between Israel and Hamas that would ease the blockade in exchange for ratcheting down the border protests.  Demonstrators each week approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.  In recent days, Israel allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of unpaid workers.  A diplomatic official said the cease-fire included an “understanding” to return to a 2014 cease-fire that promised some relief for Gaza in exchange for quiet.  The official said he expected a return to the situation before the latest burst of violence and for mediators to resume their efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.  Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters at U.N. headquarters that “we are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.”  The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed consultations on the Hamas-Israel clashes later Tuesday at the request of Kuwait and Bolivia, U.N. diplomats said.  Federman reported from Jerusalem.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that revoked an Obama-era policy requiring U.S. intelligence officials to report civilian deaths in drone strikes outside of active war zones. President Barack Obama put the policy in place in 2016 as part of an effort to be more transparent about drone strikes after he had dramatically increased their use against Islamist militants. Trump’s rescinding of the policy was done with little fanfare. The White House released the text of his executive order. “This action eliminates superfluous reporting requirements, requirements that do not improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission,” an administration official said. The Obama policy had required the U.S. director of national intelligence to release by May 1 each year an unclassified summary of the number of strikes undertaken by the United States against militant targets outside areas of active hostilities. “The United States government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict, minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, civilian casualties, and acknowledging responsibility when they unfortunately occur during military operations,” the administration official said. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, in a statement called the requirement issued by Obama “an important measure of transparency,” and said “there is simply no justification” for cancelling it. “Today’s decision underscores the need for Congress to make this reporting mandatory, something I intend to pursue through the Intelligence Authorization Act this year,” he said.

      " At least four people have died in the storm, which has ravaged coastal areas from Colombia to the Dutch island of St. Maarten.  As of Thursday afternoon, the storm was stalled 35 miles west-southwest of St. Maartin and is forecasted to move slowly to the east-northeast. Lenny is currently classified as a Category Four storm, capable of causing extensive damage and a 13 to 18 foot storm surge.  Earlier Thursday morning, the storm forced a Russian freighter carrying cement to run aground near 17th-century El Morro fortress in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Although forecasters predict Lenny will not strike the U.S., meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the Florida coast could still feel the hurricane’s effects.  “The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable distances away,” Stewart said  Lenny, the fifth major hurricane of the season, began to batter the Caribbean Wednesday, causing some of its worst damage on the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  “There’s extensive damage to the waterfront,” St. Croix resident Herb Shoenbaum told Reuters. “About 20 roofs off to the west of the island. Power and telephone lines down in a few places.”  When St. Croix sustained a direct hit from the storm Wednesday night, Lenny’s wind speeds had increased to 150 mph — just 5 mph short of Category Five strength.  The storm cut power and telephone service to many homes, uprooted trees and caused damage to structures. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would send damage assessors to the Virgin Islands Thursday. Medical teams were sent to the islands before the storm hit.  Of the four deaths attributed to the storm, two died in Colombia, one in St. Maartin and one in Puerto Rico. \n",

      " TORONTO — Former hostage Joshua Boyle said upon arriving back in Canada that the Haqqani network in Afghanistan had killed his infant daughter and raped his American wife during the years they were held in captivity.  Boyle gave the statement shortly after landing in Canada late Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and three young children.  The couple was rescued Wednesday, five years after they had been abducted by the Taliban-linked extremist network while in Afghanistan as part of a backpacking trip. Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists at the Toronto airport.  “The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network’s kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,” he said.  Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors. He asked for the Afghan government to bring them to justice.  “God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network,” he said.  He said he was in Afghanistan to help villagers “who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.”  On the plane from London, Boyle provided a written statement to The Associated Press saying his family has “unparalleled resilience and determination.”  Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-colored headscarf.  She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap. U.S. State Department officials were on the plane with them.   The handwritten statement that Boyle gave the AP expressed disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.  “God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,” he wrote.  He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, “Their interests are not my interests.”  He added that one of his children is in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.  The family was able to leave the plane with their escorts before the rest of the passengers. There was a short delay before everyone else was allowed out.  “It will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children to call a home,” he said in his later statement at the airport. “To try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost.”  Dan Boyle, Joshua’s younger brother, said outside the family home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, that he had spoken to his brother a few times in the past few days.  “He’s doing very well. He sounds a lot like how he sounded five years ago. He sounds like he had his head on his shoulders and his wits about him,” he said.  The Canadian government said in a statement they will “continue to support him and his family now that they have returned.”  “Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,” the Canadian government said.  Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, said the Pakistani raid that led to the family’s rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a “common enemy” when Washington shares information.  U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network.  U.S. officials consider it a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the Haqqani group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.  A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages — and they did.  President Donald Trump, who previously had warned Pakistan to stop harboring militants, praised Pakistan for its “cooperation on many fronts.” On Twitter, he wrote Friday that the U.S. is starting to develop “a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.”  The operation appeared to have unfolded quickly and ended with what some described as a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor’s final, terrifying threat to “kill the hostage.” Boyle told his parents that he, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back or trunk of their captors’ car and that some of his captors were killed. He suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said.  U.S. officials did not confirm those details.  A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan Wednesday prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go, but sometime after daybreak Thursday, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board, the official said.  Boyle’s father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base and the family wanted to return directly to North America. Another U.S. official said Boyle was nervous about being in “custody” given his family ties.  He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.  The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle’s capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a “horrible coincidence.”  The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.  The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners, or he and his wife would be killed.  U.S. officials have said that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan.  They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had traveled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014.

      "(Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties have failed to leave the main port city of Hodeidah three months after agreeing to a breakthrough U.N.-led truce deal as part of efforts to end a four-year-old war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine. FILE PHOTO: Houthi militants ride on the back of a truck as they withdraw, part of a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement signed in Sweden earlier this month, from the Red Sea city of Hodeidah, Yemen December 29, 2018. REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad The following is a timeline of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country’s slide into violence and how the conflict has developed. * 1990. Unification of north and south Yemen to form a single state under president Ali Abdullah Saleh. * 1994. Civil war in which Saleh prevents south, angered by what it sees as its lower status, from splitting with north. * 2003-09. Houthi group in north protests marginalisation of the local Zaydi Shi’ite Muslim sect and fights six wars with Saleh’s forces and one with Saudi Arabia. * 2011. Arab Spring protests undermine Saleh’s rule, lead to splits in the army and allow al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to seize swathes of territory in the east. * 2012. Saleh steps down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi becomes interim president and oversees a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. * 2013. AQAP survives military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. Saleh and his allies undermine the political transition. * 2014. The Houthis rapidly advance south from Saadeh and seize Sanaa on September 21 with help from Saleh. They demand a share in power. * 2015. Hadi tries to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Iran-aligned Houthis and Saleh, who arrest him. He escapes, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later the coalition, aiming to restore Hadi’s ousted government, drives the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidify, setting up years of stalemate. * 2016. AQAP takes advantage of the chaos to establish a mini-state around Mukalla in east Yemen, raising fears the war will lead to a new surge in jihadist activity. The UAE backs local forces in a battle that ends the group’s rule there. Hunger grows as the coalition imposes a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports, something it denies. Coalition air strikes that kill civilians prompt warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continues. * 2017. The Houthis launch a growing number of missiles deep into Saudi Arabia, including at Riyadh. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by reneging on his Houthi allies, Saleh switches sides, but is killed trying to escape them. Friction also develops between fighters in Aden backed by Saudi Arabia, and those backed by its Emirati coalition partners. * 2018. Coalition-backed forces, including some flying the southern separatist flag, advance up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. Hodeidah handles the bulk of Yemen’s commercial and aid imports and is critical for feeding the population of 30 million. Military stalemate ensues: the Houthis control the port and coalition-backed Yemeni forces mass on the outskirts. In the first major breakthrough in peace efforts, the warring parties agree at December talks in Sweden, the first in two years, on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah. Work on a prisoner swap also begins. *2019. The Stockholm Hodeidah truce largely holds but the withdrawal has yet to materialise amid deep mistrust between the Houthi movement, which controls Hodeidah, and the Saudi-led coalition massed on its outskirts. Violence continues in parts of Yemen outside Hodeidah.

      " ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan was sworn in as prime minister on Saturday despite protests by opposition parties, which accuse the security services of intervening on his behalf in last month’s elections.  Khan’ s Tehreek-e-Insaf party won the most seats in the July 25 national elections but fell short of an outright majority. It allied with independents to form a coalition, and Khan was elected by the National Assembly on Friday. Khan had campaigned on promises to combat Pakistan’s endemic corruption and break powerful landowners’ monopoly on political power.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha      TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY – RC163C748B00  Opposition parties have held regular protests since last month’s election, alleging vote rigging by the powerful security establishment. Security officials have rejected the allegations, and Khan has vowed to investigate the charges of voting fraud, saying neither he nor his party was involved in any wrongdoing.  “We have not committed any rigging,” he told lawmakers in a speech after being sworn in.  Imran Khan, cricketer-turned-politician and head of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) is surrounded with supporters as he leaves to lead a peace march against U.S. drone strikes from Islamabad to South Waziristan October 6, 2012. About 1000 PTI supporters including U.S. peace activists took part in a peace march which started on Saturday from Islamabad and due to reach South Waziristan on Sunday, according to local media. REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood  (PAKISTAN – Tags: POLITICS CIVIL UNREST) – GM1E8A61AWI01  Khan secured 176 votes in the assembly on Friday, defeating the opposition’s candidate, Shahbaz Sharif of the Pakistan Muslim League, who got 96 votes. Sharif and his party’s lawmakers disrupted Khan’s speech by chanting slogans against him. Khan responded by saying no one could blackmail him through such protests.  Khan has promised “ruthless accountability” to combat corruption, and has said he will move to a small house in Islamabad rather than live in the lavish prime minister’s residence.  The U.S. government issued a statement Saturday “welcoming” the new prime minister.  “For over 70 years, the relationship between the United States and Pakistan has been a vital one,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in the statement. “The United States looks forward to working with Pakistan’s new civilian government to promote peace and prosperity in Pakistan and the region.”  Pakistan’s former cricket captain Imran Khan (L) presents a memento to Indian captain Rahul Dravid (C) while V.

His first wife was the wealthy British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, whom he married in 1996. Their two sons live with Goldsmith. He married his second wife, British journalist Rehman Khan, in 2015, but they divorced within a year. Earlier this year, he married his spiritual adviser, Bushra Maneka, who attended Saturday’s ceremony when Khan took the oath as premier.  Khan emerged as a critic of the so-called War on Terror after the 9/11 attacks, accusing the United States of fueling extremism by carrying out drone strikes in Pakistan that killed civilians. He has also expressed support for a controversial law that makes blasphemy against Islam punishable by death.

REUTERS/Moshin Raza DW/RCS – RP3DRHYQRCAB  His critics in Pakistan have branded him “Taliban Khan,” accusing him of sympathizing with extremists.  Khan has denied those charges, and struck a more moderate tone in this year’s campaign, saying he was committed to defeating Islamic extremists and cultivating good relations with the U.S., which for years has demanded that Pakistan do more to combat militancy.  Khan has expressed support for a peace process in neighboring Afghanistan that would end 17 years of war between the U.S.-backed government and the Taliban.  Also on Saturday, Khan’s party nominated Arif Alvi as its candidate for the Sept. 4 presidential election. The ruling party’s candidate usually wins the post, which is a ceremonial one. The president is indirectly elected by lawmakers from the National Assembly and the four provincial assemblies. \n",

      "A well known Pakistani politician Naeemul Haque has called the Taliban Chief Mullah Akhtar Mansoor a martyr after he was killed in a drone strike in Balochistan province. Haque is a spokesman for Pakistan’s Tehrik-e-Insaf led by former cricketer Imran Khan. He defended his stance over calling Afghan militant Mullah Mansour a ‘martyr’ during an interview with the local newspaper. “Fighting to liberate your homeland is a just cause,” Naeem told Dawn.com, a day after he spoke on a TV show and called the head of an outlawed group a ‘martyr’. The remarks by Haque come as Pakistan has long been criticized for supporting the Afghan militant groups, specifically the Taliban group and the notorious Haqqani terrorist network. The Afghan officials occasionally slam Pakistani for allowing the militant groups to use its soil as shelter and plan and coordinate attacks in Afghanistan. Earlier, an influential Pakistani religious scholar who was once labeled as the ‘Father of Taliban’ has endorsed the war skills of the newly-appointed Taliban chief. “Those who think that Haibatullah is a mere cleric and a seminary preacher will soon bear witness to his skill as a militant commander,” he told Dawn after a Defence of Pakistan Council (DPC) meeting in the capital on Monday. He blamed the United States for the persistent violence and said “It was America that resorted to violence again; the assassination of Mullah Mansour is nothing short of murder.” However, the Afghan defense officials dismissed the remarks by Sami-ul-Haq and said Mullah Akhundzada would not kill the civilians if he was a military expert and had religious knowledge.

      "The US government has reportedly named Army Lt. Gen. Austin Scott Miller as the new commander of the US forces in Afghanistan. Reports regarding the nomination of Gen. Miller as the new commander of US forces in Afghanistan emerges amid ongoing efforts to defeat the 17-year long insurgency in Afghanistan led mainly by the Taliban. Despite the announcement of the new strategy for South Asia, mainly focusing on increased pressures on Taliban, fewer strategic successes have been achieved in the past few months. According to TIME Magazine, selection of Miller indicates the Trump Administration may be rethinking its conventional approach. Gen. Miller’s 35-year background draws on decades of experience in commanding clandestine commando teams, working with foreign partners, and collaborating with intelligence agencies to target terror groups — often resulting in drone strikes and nighttime raids. According to the TIME, Miller has his work cut out for him. Afghan forces remain riddled with corruption and heavily reliant upon American intelligence and firepower to maintain a semblance of control of their country. The central government held just 56% of the country’s 407 districts, as of Jan. 31. In the meantime, Ronald E. Neumann, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served as ambassador to Afghanistan, Bahrain and Algeria, has told TIME that “I don’t know if anyone can solve Afghanistan’s problems. If the Trump Administration stays committed, I’m confident Scott Miller will deliver positive results.” Michael Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has told the TIME that Miller’s rare mix of combat experience, oversight of training missions, and interest in Afghan culture makes him the “best athlete” the military has to offer in taking command in Afghanistan.

The Afghan President in a statement said the terrorist groups have suffered unprecedented losses during the operations of the Afghan security forces and such attacks in the capital shows that the terrorist groups are attempting to hide their losses. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terrorist group claimed responsibility behind the attack, claiming that 8 US troops were killed. However, the Ministry of Interior of Afghanistan said at least eight civilians were killed and 25 others were wounded in the attack. The attack by ISIS on coalition forces convoy comes at a time when the Afghan forces with the support of the US forces based in the country have stepped up attacks against the terror group in the areas where they operate, specifically in eastern Nangarhar province.

A series of U.S. drone attacks bombed North Waziristan over the past few days in three separate attacks, killing at least 14 people. Pakistani officials told the diplomat, who was not identified, that the attacks were unacceptable, unlawful and a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. “The US Embassy was today demarched on recent drone strikes in North Waziristan. A senior US diplomat was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and informed that the drone strikes were unlawful, against international law and a violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty,” said a brief statement issued by the Foreign Office spokesman. “It was emphatically stated that such attacks were unacceptable,” the statement said. The United States has ignored Pakistan’s calls for a halt to drone strikes, which Islamabad says are counterproductive in the war on terror and spark anti-American sentiments. But Washington insists that the attacks are the key to eliminate al-Qaeda remnants and Taliban. The strikes are very unpopular in Pakistan because many people believe they mostly kill civilians – an allegation disputed by the U.S.   Post Views:  77\n",

      "A UN official has warned that US drone attacks on Pakistan’s tribal districts are carried out without the consent of the government in Islamabad and are a violation of its sovereignty. Ben Emmerson QC, the UN’s special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights returning from a three-day visit to Islamabad said  he had been given assurances that there was no “tacit consent by Pakistan to the use of drones on its territory”. Emmerson’s investigation team has gathered numerous reports from residents who witnessed the terrifying attacks. “Adult males carrying out ordinary daily tasks were frequently the victims of such strikes,” a statement from the UN office for human rights said. The strikes have sparked growing controversy due to their secret nature. However, the US has denied that its attacks have killed hundreds of people. President Barack Obama has stepped up covert CIA drone strikes targeting al-Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistan’s tribal region along the Afghan border since he took office in 2009. The strikes have caused growing controversy because of the secrecy surrounding them and claims that they have caused significant civilian casualties – allegations denied by the United States. CIA director John Brennan has said that only in “exceedingly rare” cases have civilians been “accidentally injured, or worse, killed in these strikes.” However reports by independent groups corroborate Emmerson’s account, concluding that drones mistakenly target and kill a significant number of civilians. The New America Foundation estimates that in Pakistan, drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 – and that between 18% and 23% of them were not militants. The nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10% in 2012, the group says.   Post Views:  88\n",

      " WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is calling for an urgent halt to the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen and the start of negotiations in November toward a political settlement.  The renewed push for a political solution in Yemen comes amid growing criticism of U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia’s Yemen air campaign in the aftermath of the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged a cease-fire, specifically citing missile and drone strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis are supported by Iran. He added the airstrikes by the Arab coalition, backed by the U.S., “must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.”  “The time is now for a cessation of hostilities,” Pompeo said in a written statement Tuesday evening shortly after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made similar statements in an appearance at the United States Institute of Peace.  Mattis was more specific than Pompeo in his call for urgent movement toward a political solution to the fighting. He said a cease-fire should take effect within 30 days.      “We’re calling on all the parties, specifically the Houthis and the Arab coalition, to meet in Sweden in November and to come to a solution.”   “We’re calling on all the parties, specifically the Houthis and the Arab coalition, to meet in Sweden in November and to come to a solution,” Mattis said.  Sweden’s foreign minister said Wednesday that Griffiths has asked Sweden to host such talks.  Mattis called for demilitarization of Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia “so that the Saudis and the Emirates do not have to worry about missiles coming into their homes and cities and airports.” He also said measures should be taken to “ensure that all Iranian-supplied missiles to the Houthis” are put under “international watch.”  Mattis put primary blame on Iran. He said its proxies and surrogate forces are fueling the conflict.  “They need to knock it off,” he said.  The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis, who toppled the internationally recognized government. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015. \n",
