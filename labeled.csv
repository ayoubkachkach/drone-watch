An explosion took place in the vicinity of Makroryan area of the city earlier today which is located close to the US Embassy in Kabul with the security officials saying only three civilians were wounded. However, ISIS loyalists released a statement on the Amaq news agency saying that they had killed the US commander and two Afghan army colonels using a ‘sticky bomb’. The loyalists of the terror group claimed it happened outside the US embassy in the Afghan capital in Masoud Square. The latest claim by the loyalists of the terror group come as the Afghan and US forces have stepped up raids gainst them in eastern Nangarhar province where they have been widely conducting insurgency activities. The leader of the terror group Hafeez Saeed Khan was killed in a US drone strike in Nangarhar province late in the month of July.

The majority of the strikes were carried out during the government of Pakistan Peoples Party between 2008 and 2012. Sources within the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) recently shared details, claiming that the period saw 336 aerial attacks, in which 2,282 people lost their lives and 658 received injuries. The officials added that 2010 alone saw 117 attacks that cost 775 people their lives and injured another 193. Between 2013 and 2018 — during the government of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz — a total of 65 drone attacks occurred. A total of 301 people died and 70 were injured. In 2018, two drone attacks have been conducted so far. One person was killed and one was injured.  It is, however, worth remembering that the top leadership of the Taliban in Pakistan has been killed in drone attacks.  The attacks over the years have targeted the areas of Bajaur, Bannu, Hangu, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, North Waziristan, Nushki, Orakzai, and South Waziristan. The officials of Nacta added that 289 attacks were conducted in North Waziristan alone, in which 1,651 individuals were killed and 421 were injured. South Waziristan saw 91 attacks that killed 707 individuals and injured 215. There were 13 strikes in the Kurram Agency that killed 110 and injured 32, five in the Khyber Agency that killed 57 and injured 29, four in the Bajaur Agency that killed 129, two in Hangu that killed seven and injured two, one in the Mohmand Agency that killed 18 and injured 18 and one in Nushki that killed two.

33016,NOT_STRIKE,"BEIJING: China’s ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office. Since taking office more than five years ago, Xi has overseen a radical shake-up of the party, including taking down top leaders once thought untouchable as part of his popular war on deep-rooted corruption. Sunday’s announcement, carried by state news agency Xinhua, gave few details. It said the proposal had been made by the party’s Central Committee, the largest of its elite ruling bodies. The proposal also covers the vice president position.  Radical shake-up has taken place in Communist Party during Xi’s presidential term as part of his war on corruption  Xi, 64, is currently required by China’s constitution to step down as president after two five-year terms. Nearing the end of his first term, he will be formally elected to a second at the annual meeting of China’s parliament opening on March 5. There is no limit on his tenure as the party and military chief, though a maximum 10-year term is the norm. He began his second term as head of the party and military in October at the end of a party congress held once every five years. Zhang Lifan, a historian and political commentator, said the news was not unexpected, and it was hard to predict exactly how long Xi could stay on in power. “In theory he could serve longer than Mugabe but in reality, no one is sure exactly what will happen,” Zhang said, referring to Zimbabwe’s former president whose four decades in office ended in November, after the army and his former political allies moved to force him out. Though positive remarks filled the comments section under the pages of main state media outlets like the People’s Daily, the move was not welcomed by everyone on China’s Twitter-like Weibo service. “If two terms are not enough, then they can write in a third term, but there needs to be a limit. Getting rid of it is not good!,” wrote one Weibo user. ‘Emperor Xi’ Constitutional reform needs to be approved by parliament, which is stacked with members chosen for their loyalty to the party — meaning the reform will not be blocked. There has been persistent speculation that Xi wants to stay on in office past the customary two five-year terms. The October party congress ended without appointing a clear eventual successor for Xi. However, the role of party chief is more senior than that of president. At some point, Xi could be given a party position that also enables him to stay on as long as he likes. Xi is currently the party’s general secretary, but not chairman. China’s first three leaders after the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949 all carried the title of party chairman — Mao Zedong, Hua Guofeng and then Hu Yaobang. It has not been used since. “Whether Xi ends up being party chairman or just remains party secretary doesn’t really matter. What matters is whether he holds onto power,” said Zhang Ming, a professor of political science at Renmin University of China in Beijing. “Titles don’t matter as much in China as they do in the West. Here what matters is whether you are the emperor,” he added. “In China, ordinary people already consider Xi Jinping to be the emperor.” Eyes on VP Mao, the founder of Communist China and still held in god-like awe by many Chinese, died while still Communist Party chairman in 1976, having never retired. State media has also increasingly been using the term “lingxiu” to refer to Xi, which means “leader”. Distinct from the standard usage of “lingdao” for leader, “lingxiu” evokes grander, almost spiritual, connotations. Mao, for example, was referred to as “lingxiu”, but Xi’s two immediate predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, were not. In a Sunday commentary on its WeChat account, state television said: “The people love the people’s ‘lingxiu’!”, above a picture of Xi being greeted by an adoring crowd in Sichuan province earlier this month. The move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. The party has been laying the groundwork for Xi not to have to go. One of Xi’s closest political allies, former top graft buster Wang Qishan, stepped down from the party’s standing committee -- the seven-man body that runs China — in October. Aged 69, Wang had reached the age at which top officials tend to retire. But he has been chosen as a parliament delegate this year and is likely to become vice president, sources with ties to the leadership and diplomats say. The move is significant because if Wang does not retire, that would set a precedent for Xi to stay on in power too after he reaches what is normally considered retirement age.

525,NOT_STRIKE,"(Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties have failed to leave the main port city of Hodeidah three months after agreeing to a breakthrough U.N.-led truce deal as part of efforts to end a four-year-old war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine. FILE PHOTO: Houthi militants ride on the back of a truck as they withdraw, part of a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement signed in Sweden earlier this month, from the Red Sea city of Hodeidah, Yemen December 29, 2018. REUTERS/Abduljabbar Zeyad The following is a timeline of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country’s slide into violence and how the conflict has developed. * 1990. Unification of north and south Yemen to form a single state under president Ali Abdullah Saleh. * 1994. Civil war in which Saleh prevents south, angered by what it sees as its lower status, from splitting with north. * 2003-09. Houthi group in north protests marginalisation of the local Zaydi Shi’ite Muslim sect and fights six wars with Saleh’s forces and one with Saudi Arabia. * 2011. Arab Spring protests undermine Saleh’s rule, lead to splits in the army and allow al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to seize swathes of territory in the east. * 2012. Saleh steps down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi becomes interim president and oversees a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. * 2013. AQAP survives military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. Saleh and his allies undermine the political transition. * 2014. The Houthis rapidly advance south from Saadeh and seize Sanaa on September 21 with help from Saleh. They demand a share in power. * 2015. Hadi tries to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Iran-aligned Houthis and Saleh, who arrest him. He escapes, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later the coalition, aiming to restore Hadi’s ousted government, drives the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidify, setting up years of stalemate. * 2016. AQAP takes advantage of the chaos to establish a mini-state around Mukalla in east Yemen, raising fears the war will lead to a new surge in jihadist activity. The UAE backs local forces in a battle that ends the group’s rule there. Hunger grows as the coalition imposes a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports, something it denies. Coalition air strikes that kill civilians prompt warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continues. * 2017. The Houthis launch a growing number of missiles deep into Saudi Arabia, including at Riyadh. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by reneging on his Houthi allies, Saleh switches sides, but is killed trying to escape them. Friction also develops between fighters in Aden backed by Saudi Arabia, and those backed by its Emirati coalition partners. * 2018. Coalition-backed forces, including some flying the southern separatist flag, advance up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. Hodeidah handles the bulk of Yemen’s commercial and aid imports and is critical for feeding the population of 30 million. Military stalemate ensues: the Houthis control the port and coalition-backed Yemeni forces mass on the outskirts. In the first major breakthrough in peace efforts, the warring parties agree at December talks in Sweden, the first in two years, on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah. Work on a prisoner swap also begins. *2019. The Stockholm Hodeidah truce largely holds but the withdrawal has yet to materialise amid deep mistrust between the Houthi movement, which controls Hodeidah, and the Saudi-led coalition massed on its outskirts. Violence continues in parts of Yemen outside Hodeidah.

1658,NOT_STRIKE," GENEVA — People smugglers are taking greater risks to ferry their human cargo toward Europe as Libya’s coast guard intercepts more and more boats carrying migrants, increasing the likelihood that those on board may die during the Mediterranean journeys, the U.N. refugee agency said Monday.  That’s one of the key findings from a new UNHCR report about efforts to reach Europe. The report, titled “ Desperate Journeys ,” said that even though the number of crossings and deaths has plunged compared to recent years, the voyage is more deadly in percentage terms for those who venture across.  It said that 2,276 people died last year while trying to cross, or one death for every 42 arrivals.  This year, it’s 1,095 deaths, or one out of every 18 arrivals. In June alone, the proportion hit one death for every seven arrivals.  On the Central Mediterranean route so far this year, there have been 10 separate incidents in which 50 or more people died — most after departing from Libya. Seven of those incidents have been since June alone, UNHCR said.      “The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards.”   “The reason the traffic has become more deadly is that the traffickers are taking more risk, because there is more surveillance exercised by the Libyan coast guards,” said Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR’s special envoy for the central Mediterranean. “They are trying to cut the costs: It costs them more to keep those people here longer in their warehouses, under captivity.”  Libyan authorities intercepted or rescued 18,400 people between August last year and July this year — a 38-percent increase from the same period of 2016 and 2017. Arrivals by sea from Libya to Europe plummeted 82 percent in those comparable periods, to 30,800 in the more recent one.  UNHCR says a growing worry these days is deaths on land by people trying to get to Libya in the first place, or getting stuck in squalid, overcrowded detention centers: Many get returned there after failing to cross by sea to Europe.  “The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centers, and many disappear,” Cochetel said. “Many are sold to militias, and to traffickers, and people employing them without paying them.”  He said the drop in departures means that traffickers attempt to “monetize their investment, which means they have to exploit more people. That results in more cases of slavery, forced labor, prostitution of those people — because they (smugglers) want to make money on those people.”      “The problems after disembarkation (is that) those people are sent back to detention centers, and many disappear.”   Would-be workers and migrants are still pouring into Libya: Some are fleeing injustice, abuse or autocrats in their home countries further south in Africa. Others are looking for work in the oil industry or agriculture.  “I think you have more deaths on land,” Cochetel said, referring to treks across the desert in Sudan, Algeria, Chad and Niger. “Many people in Libya are reporting having seeing people dead in the desert on the way to Libya.”  In Libya, instability continues even seven years after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi. French medical aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that fighting between rival militias in Tripoli, the capital, has endangered the lives of people trapped there and worsened humanitarian needs — especially at migrant detention centers.  Cochetel said Europe — where some countries have shown “appalling” squabbles about who would take in rescue ships carrying migrants — should look at the root causes of such journeys. European populations need to shun anti-migrant rhetoric and realize that figures are down sharply, and migrant flows are clearly manageable at current levels, he said.  “Europe has to show the lead, has to be exemplary in its response, but it’s quite clear that it’s already too late when the people are in Libya,” he said. “We need to work downstream in country of first asylum, in country of origin, and that takes time.” ",False,2018-09-03 14:27:00+00:00,2019-03-23 00:29:58.731442+00:00,1659,True,1,"UN agency: Trips across Mediterranean fall, but risks rise",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/un-agency-trips-across-mediterranean-fall-but-risks-rise

As of Thursday afternoon, the storm was stalled 35 miles west-southwest of St. Maartin and is forecasted to move slowly to the east-northeast. Lenny is currently classified as a Category Four storm, capable of causing extensive damage and a 13 to 18 foot storm surge.  Earlier Thursday morning, the storm forced a Russian freighter carrying cement to run aground near 17th-century El Morro fortress in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Although forecasters predict Lenny will not strike the U.S., meteorologist Stacy Stewart at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the Florida coast could still feel the hurricane’s effects.  “The influence of this storm is going to be felt considerable distances away,” Stewart said  Lenny, the fifth major hurricane of the season, began to batter the Caribbean Wednesday, causing some of its worst damage on the island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  “There’s extensive damage to the waterfront,” St. Croix resident Herb Shoenbaum told Reuters. “About 20 roofs off to the west of the island. Power and telephone lines down in a few places.”  When St. Croix sustained a direct hit from the storm Wednesday night, Lenny’s wind speeds had increased to 150 mph — just 5 mph short of Category Five strength.  The storm cut power and telephone service to many homes, uprooted trees and caused damage to structures. The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency said it would send damage assessors to the Virgin Islands Thursday. Medical teams were sent to the islands before the storm hit.

REUTERS/Mohamed al-Sayaghi ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group said they were building their ballistic capabilities and their forces stand ready to strike Riyadh and Abu Dhabi if implementation of a U.N. peace deal in the port city of Hodeidah is breached. A spokesman of the Houthi forces said the group has a “stockpile of missiles” and the group can hit Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the two Gulf states leading the coalition backing the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, whenever the military command decides on the timing. “We have intelligence asserting that the enemy is preparing for an escalation in Hodeidah and we are following their movements closely. Our forces stand ready for any requested and adequate measure,” colonel Yahya Sarea, a spokesman of the Houthi forces, was quoted as saying by the group-controlled state news agency SABA late on Saturday. Sarea said the nature of the conflict, which is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and its regional rival Iran, has made ballistic missiles and drones a “strategic choice” and the only response to the Saudi-led coalition air strikes. The Saudi-led coalition accuses the Houthis of breaching an agreement signed in Stockholm last December, after they failed to withdraw from the port of Hodeidah, the first step of the peace plan. The Houthis say they want more guarantees from the U.N. that the other side will not exploit their withdrawal. The two sides have agreed on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal in Hodeidah, an exchange of prisoners, and the reopening of humanitarian corridors to help millions of starving Yemenis, with international monitors to oversee things. The ceasefire in Hodeidah has largely held but violence escalated elsewhere. Last week, air strikes on a village in the northern Hajjah province killed 10 women and 12 children and wounded 30 people.

1137,NOT_STRIKE," GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip — Hamas and other militant groups said Tuesday they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire to end two days of intense fighting with Israel that had pushed the sworn enemies to the brink of a new war.  The sudden announcement brought relief to a region that had been paralyzed by hundreds of Palestinian rocket attacks in southern Israel and scores of Israeli airstrikes on targets in the Gaza Strip. But it did not address the deeper issues that pushed Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers toward their latest violence and left doubts about international efforts to forge a broader truce agreement.  Those efforts had appeared to be making progress in recent days as Israel allowed Qatar to deliver financial aid to the cash-strapped Hamas government, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that he wanted to avert an “unnecessary” war in Gaza. Hamas, in turn, had scaled back its mass protests that have led to weekly bloodshed along the Israeli border.      Tuesday’s cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas’ vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.   But hours after Netanyahu spoke Sunday, an Israeli commando unit on an undercover mission was caught behind enemy lines in Gaza by Hamas militants. Their discovery set off a battle that led to the deaths of seven militants and an Israeli officer, and triggered the heaviest barrage of rocket fire since a 2014 war.  The Israeli military said that Palestinian militants fired 460 rockets and mortars into Israel in a 24-hour period, while it carried out airstrikes on 160 targets in Gaza. Seven Palestinians, including five militants, were killed, and 26 people were wounded. In Israel, a 48-year-old Palestinian laborer was killed in a rocket strike on an apartment building where he was staying. Nearly 30 people were wounded, three critically.  With air raid sirens wailing throughout southern Israel and the explosions of airstrikes thundering in Gaza, the sides had appeared to be headed to what would have been their fourth war in a decade.  But late Tuesday, Hamas and other military groups issued a joint statement saying they had accepted an Egyptian cease-fire.  Terms of the deal appeared to be modest. Daoud Shehab, a spokesman for the Islamic Jihad militant group, said each side would promise quiet in exchange for quiet.  “It’s a mutual commitment to the cease-fire,” he said. “From our side, we responded positively to the Egyptian endeavor on the condition that the occupation does the same.”  The announcement set off celebrations in Gaza City as Hamas supporters declared victory.  At a demonstration staged in the rubble of Hamas’ TV station, demolished by an Israeli airstrike, crowds chanted the name of Hamas’ military wing. Shops reopened and cars jammed the streets. Israeli reconnaissance drones continued to buzz overhead.  Ismail Radwan, a Hamas official, expressed Hamas’ commitment to the cease-fire but warned that “our hands are on the trigger” if Israel violates the agreement.  In Israel, officials had no comment on the cease-fire claim even as dozens of protesters in the rocket-battered town of Sderot chanted “Disgrace!” at what they saw as the government’s capitulation to militant violence. But after nightfall, both the rocket attacks and Israeli airstrikes had stopped.  KHAN YUNIS, GAZA – NOVEMBER 12: Funeral ceremony for seven Palestinians, including a military commander of Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas movement, held after they were killed in Israeli attack in Khan Yunis, Gaza on November 12, 2018. (Photo by Mustafa Hassona/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)  The announcement came shortly after Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet ended a seven-hour discussion on the rising tensions in Gaza.  The Cabinet said it had ordered the military to “continue operations as needed.” Israel’s Channel 10 TV reported deep divisions among the participants, with several hard-line ministers reportedly opposed to another cease-fire with Hamas.  Hamas, an Islamic militant group that opposes Israel’s existence, seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority in 2007.  Israel and Egypt immediately imposed a blockade on Gaza to contain Hamas. The blockade has ravaged Gaza’s economy, and Israel refuses to lift it unless Hamas disarms, a demand the militants reject.  The standoff has produced repeated rounds of violence, including indiscriminate Gaza rocket fire at Israeli towns and cities and punishing Israeli military offensives, but Hamas remains firmly in control. Netanyahu’s apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.  Israel Ziv, a retired general who once commanded the Israeli military’s Gaza division, said Netanyahu was running out of options for dealing with Hamas.  “Either we come to a settlement or there’s an all-out campaign. Nothing in the middle is going to make a difference,” he said.  Tuesday’s cease-fire did not appear to address any of the underlying issues, including the blockade and Hamas’ vast arsenal of rockets, and it was unclear whether U.N. and Egyptian efforts toward a broader deal might resume.      Netanyahu’s apparent reluctance to launch a full-scale war reflected the lack of good choices at his disposal.   U.N. and Egyptian mediators had been making progress in recent weeks toward informal understandings between Israel and Hamas that would ease the blockade in exchange for ratcheting down the border protests.  Demonstrators each week approach the border fence, throwing firebombs, grenades and burning tires at Israeli troops. Israeli snipers have killed about 170 people, most of them unarmed. Israel says it is defending its border against attackers, but it has come under heavy international criticism for shooting unarmed people.  In recent days, Israel allowed fuel shipments to increase the power supply in Gaza, which suffers from frequent blackouts, and agreed to additional Qatari assistance to allow Hamas to pay the salaries of its thousands of unpaid workers.  A diplomatic official said the cease-fire included an “understanding” to return to a 2014 cease-fire that promised some relief for Gaza in exchange for quiet.  The official said he expected a return to the situation before the latest burst of violence and for mediators to resume their efforts. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the media.  Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told reporters at U.N. headquarters that “we are grateful for the Egyptians who are mediating.”  The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed consultations on the Hamas-Israel clashes later Tuesday at the request of Kuwait and Bolivia, U.N. diplomats said.  Federman reported from Jerusalem.

21498,NOT_STRIKE,"  US, S. Korea start drills in show of force against N. Korea    United States (US) President Donald Trump was due to land in Hanoi on Saturday, as North Korea slammed his “warmonger” Asia tour, saying it will only accelerate Pyongyang's push for a full-fledged nuclear deterrent. Trump has repeatedly railed against the North as he urges the region to take a united front against the threat posed by the isolated nation, which has sparked global alarm with nuclear and missile tests in recent months. On Friday he warned world leaders gathered in the Vietnamese resort city of Danang that the Asia-Pacific region “must not be held hostage to a dictator's twisted fantasies”. Pyongyang issued its retort Saturday branding Trump's Asia tour a “warmonger's visit for confrontation to rid the DPRK of its self-defensive nuclear deterrence”, in the first comments on the visit by a North Korean official. Tensions over the North's weapons programme have surged in recent months, as Pyongyang carried out a sixth nuclear test ─ by far its largest to date -- and test fired dozens of missiles, some capable of reaching the US mainland. North Korea has dominated Trump's trip, which has so far swept in Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam. In a speech to the South Korean parliament on Wednesday, Trump warned Pyongyang not to underestimate the United States, while offering leader Kim Jong-Un a better future if he gives up his nuclear ambitions. The North on Saturday said Trump's warnings “can never frighten us or put a stop to our advance”, according to the state-run KCNA news agency, quoting a Pyongyang foreign ministry spokesman. Instead the threat “pushes us to speed up the efforts to accomplish the great cause of completing the state nuclear force”, the statement said, dismissing Trump's tour of the region as a “business trip”. Trump will attend a state banquet on Saturday before a welcoming and deal-signing ceremony on Sunday morning. He leaves for the Philippines on Sunday afternoon where he will attend the ASEAN summit of Southeast Asian leaders. US, S. Korea start drills in show of force against N. Korea  The US and South Korea on Saturday started joint naval exercises that will involve three US aircraft carriers in what military officials describe as a clear warning to North Korea. The battle groups of the USS Ronald Reagan, the Theodore Roosevelt and the Nimitz will successively enter the exercise area during the drills that run until Tuesday in waters off South Korea's eastern coast, South Korea's joint chiefs of staff said. The three carriers will be likely together in the drills around Monday, according to a South Korean military official, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules. The exercises will also involve 11 US Aegis ships and seven South Korean naval vessels, including two Aegis ships. The Aegis technology refers to missile tracking and guidance. They will aim to enhance combined operation and aerial strike capabilities and also display “strong will and firm military readiness to defeat any provocation by North Korea with dominant force in the event of crisis,” Seoul's military said in a statement. It's the first time since a 2007 exercise near Guam that three US carrier strike groups are operating together in the Western Pacific, according to the US Navy's 7th Fleet. The US carriers will also participate in separate exercises with three Japanese destroyers on Sunday, according to Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force. The US has been sending its strategic assets, also including long-range bombers, to the region more frequently for patrols or drills amid accelerating North Korean efforts to expand its nuclear weapons program. In recent months, North Korea has tested intercontinental ballistic missiles that could reach the US mainland with further development and has conducted its most powerful nuclear test. It also flew two new midrange missiles over Japan and threatened to launch them toward Guam, a US Pacific territory and military hub.

The history of Pakistan cricket is littered with internal strife between rival cliques — the highlight of which was the infamous Waqar Younis-led mutiny against then captain Wasim Akram during the 1990s. Such conflicts, however, have diminished during the last decade, partly to make way for bigger vice such as spot-fixing but also due to the calming influence of Misbahul Haq. It, however, reared its head again during the recent tour of New Zealand when fast-bowler Hasan Ali, when criticised for some wayward bowling by Sarfraz, stared back at the skipper in an act of apparent dissent. During the same tour there were also reports of some senior players not getting along with Sarfraz as well as coach Mickey Arthur. Moin Khan, the head coach of Quetta Gladiators, discussed the issue on Thursday, asking the PCB to help command Sarfraz more respect in the dressing room by extending his captaincy until at least the 2019 World Cup.

5143,NOT_STRIKE," SANAA, Yemen — A U.S. military service member was killed Sunday during a raid against al-Qaida militants in central Yemen that also left nearly 30 others dead, including women and children. The loss of the service member is the first-known combat death of a member of the U.S. military under President Donald Trump.  “Americans are saddened this morning with news that a life of a heroic service member has been taken in our fight against the evil of radical Islamic terrorism,” Trump said in a statement.  The U.S. has been striking al-Qaida in Yemen from the air for more than 15 years, mostly using drones, and Sunday’s surprise pre-dawn raid could signal a new escalation against extremist groups in the Arab world’s poorest but strategically located country.  An al-Qaida official and an online news service linked to the terror group said the raid left about 30 people dead. Among the children killed was Anwar, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Yemeni-American cleric killed in a U.S. airstrike in Yemen in 2011, according to the girl’s grandfather.  Nasser al-Awlaki told The Associated Press that Nora was visiting her mother when the raid took place. She was shot in the neck and bled for two hours before she died, he said.  U.S. Central Command said in a statement that three service members were wounded in the raid and that a fourth one was injured in a “hard landing” in a nearby location. The aircraft was unable to fly afterward and was “intentionally destroyed, it added.  It said 14 militants from al-Qaida’s branch in Yemen, formally known as “al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula,” were killed in the assault and that U.S. service members taking part in the raid captured “information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots.”  A U.S. defense official said the raid was approved by Trump. President Barack Obama had been briefed on it before he left office on Jan. 20, but for operational reasons it was not ready to be executed before he departed, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss details beyond those announced by the Pentagon and so spoke on condition of anonymity.  Yemeni security and tribal officials said the raid in Yemen’s central Bayda province killed three senior al-Qaida leaders: Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab, and Seif al-Nims.  The al-Dhahab family, who are the late al-Awlaki’s in-laws, are considered an ally of al-Qaida, which is now chiefly concentrated in Bayda. A third family member, Tarek al-Dhahab, was the leader of al-Qaida in Bayda but was reportedly killed in a family feud.  The news service linked to al-Qaida in Yemen likened the raid to a “massacre against Muslims” and said U.S. warplanes were first seen in the sky above the area at 9 p.m. Saturday and that the raid began at 2 a.m. on Sunday, with 16 missiles hitting three houses near Yakla village in Radaa district.  A two-hour gun battle ensued after American service members landed on the ground, it said. About 30 men, women and children were killed in the raid, it added.  The killed and wounded included some Saudis present at the site, according to the Yemeni officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists.  The al-Qaida official sent to the AP in Cairo photos purportedly showing the bloodied bodies of several children killed in the raid along with houses showing bullet holes. The official requested anonymity for fear of reprisals.  Just over a week ago, suspected U.S. drone strikes killed three other alleged al-Qaida operatives in Bayda in what was the first-such killings reported in the country since Trump assumed the U.S. presidency.  The tribal officials said the Americans captured and departed with at least two unidentified individuals Sundsay, but the U.S. official in Washington said no detainees were taken in the raid.  Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, long seen by Washington as among the most dangerous branches of the global terror network, has exploited the chaos of Yemen’s civil war, seizing territory in the south and east.  The war began in 2014, when Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies swept down from the north and captured the capital, Sanaa. A Saudi-led military coalition has been helping government forces battle the rebels for nearly two years.

Earlier this year, Pakistan extended a deadline for refugees to register with the government. The country is home to about 1.5 million registered Afghan refugees .  Photographer Steve McCurry searched for Gula, or “the Afghan girl” as she came to be known, in 2002. His 1985 photo was taken at a Pakistani refugee camp and neither Gula’s name or age were known because there were no records. McCurry photographed her again in the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan.  In an email to the New York Times, McCurry said he was committed to doing anything he could to provide Gula legal and financial support.  “We object to this action by the authorities in the strongest possible terms,” he wrote. “She has suffered throughout her entire life, and we believe that her arrest is an egregious violation of her human rights.” ",False,2016-10-27 15:12:00+00:00,2019-03-23 02:52:03.749935+00:00,5635,True,1,National Geographic’s green-eyed Afghan girl arrested,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/national-geographics-green-eyed-afghan-girl-arrested
2632,NOT_STRIKE," JERUSALEM — The Israeli military on Thursday said it attacked nearly all of Iran’s military installations in neighboring Syria in response to an Iranian rocket barrage on Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights, in the most serious military confrontation between the two bitter enemies to date.  Israel said the targets of the strikes, its largest in Syria since the 1973 war, included weapons storage, logistics sites and intelligence centers used by elite Iranian forces in Syria. It also said it destroyed several Syrian air-defense systems after coming under heavy fire and that none of its warplanes were hit.  Iranian media described the attacks as “unprecedented,” but there was no official Iranian comment on Israel’s claims.  Israel has acknowledged carrying out over 100 airstrikes in neighboring Syria since the civil war erupted in 2011, most believed to be aimed at suspected Iranian weapons shipments bound for the Hezbollah militant group.  But in the past few weeks, Israel has shifted to a more direct and public confrontation with Iran, striking at Iranian bases, weapons depots and rocket launchers across Syria, and killing Iranian troops. Israel accuses Tehran of seeking to establish a foothold on its doorstep. Iran has vowed to retaliate.  Reflecting the scope of the overnight attacks, Russia’s military said 28 Israeli jets were involved, striking at several Iranian and government sites in Syria with 70 missiles. It said half of the missiles were shot down.  Speaking at the Herzliya Conference, an annual security gathering north of Tel Aviv, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel would response fiercely to any further Iranian actions.  “We will not let Iran turn Syria into a forward base against Israel,” he said. “We, of course, struck almost all the Iranian infrastructure in Syria, and they need to remember this arrogance of theirs. If we get rain, they’ll get a flood. I hope that we ended this chapter and that everyone understood.”  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which closely monitors the civil war through sources inside Syria, said the overnight Israeli attacks struck several military posts for Syrian troops and Iranian-backed militias near the capital, Damascus, in central Syria and in southern Syria. The Observatory said the attacks killed 23 fighters, including five Syrian soldiers. It said it was not immediately clear if Iranians were among those killed.  An Iranian state television presenter announced the Israeli strikes, sourcing the information to Syria’s state-run SANA news agency. The broadcaster described the Israeli attack as “unprecedented” since the 1967 Mideast war.  An Israeli tank can be seen near the Israeli side of the border with Syria in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israel. Photo by Amir Cohen/Reuters  Israel captured the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, annexing it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally. In 1974, Israel and Syria reached a cease-fire and a disengagement deal that froze the conflict lines with the plateau in Israeli hands.  Damascus shook with sounds of explosions just before dawn, and firing by Syrian air defenses over the city was heard for more than five hours. Syria’s state news agency SANA said Israeli missiles hit air defense positions, radar stations and a weapons warehouse, but claimed most incoming rockets were intercepted.  Russia sent forces to Syria to back President Bashar Assad in 2015. But Israel and Russia have maintained close communications to prevent their air forces from coming into conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Moscow on Wednesday to meet with President Vladimir Putin and discuss military coordination in Syria.  Israel said early Thursday that Iran’s Quds Force fired 20 rockets at Israeli front-line military positions in the Golan Heights. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said four of the rockets were intercepted, while the others fell short of their targets. The incoming attack set off air raid sirens in the Golan.  Conricus said Israel was not looking to escalate the situation but that troops will continue to be on “very high alert.”  “Should there be another Iranian attack, we will be prepared for it,” he said.  It is believed to be the first time in decades that such firepower from Syria has been directed at Israeli forces in the Golan Heights.  Iran’s ability to hit back further could be limited. Its resources in Syria pale in comparison to the high-tech Israeli military and it could also be wary of military entanglement at a time when it is trying to salvage the international nuclear deal.  Iran has sent thousands of troops to back Assad, and Israel fears that as the fighting nears an end, Iran and tens of thousands of Shiite militiamen will turn their focus to Israel.  Earlier this week, Syrian state media said Israel struck a military outpost near Damascus. The Observatory said the missiles targeted depots and rocket launchers that likely belonged to Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard, killing at least 15 people, eight of them Iranians.  Last month, an attack on Syria’s T4 air base in the central Homs province killed seven Iranian military personnel. On April 30, Israel was said to have struck government outposts in northern Syria, killing more than a dozen pro-government fighters, many of them Iranians.  Israel considers Iran to be its most bitter enemy, citing Iran’s hostile rhetoric, support for anti-Israel militant groups and development of long-range missiles. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran, with strong support from Israel, has further raised tensions.  Israel and Iran have appeared to be on a collision course for months.  In February, Israel shot down what it said was an armed Iranian drone that entered Israeli airspace. Israel responded by attacking anti-aircraft positions in Syria, and an Israeli warplane was shot down during the battle.  But Thursday was the first time Israel openly acknowledged targeting Iran.

41008,NOT_STRIKE,"By Manish Rai Nearly three years of bloody civil war in Syria have created what the United Nations, governments and international humanitarian organizations describe as the most challenging refugee crisis in a generation bigger than the one unleashed by the Rwandan genocide and laden with the sectarianism of the Balkan wars. With no end in sight in the conflict and with large parts of Syria already destroyed, governments and organizations are quietly preparing for the refugee crisis to last years. Governments and humanitarian groups are increasingly working under the assumption that the crisis will be a long-lasting one. This is the crisis that has been called the greatest humanitarian catastrophe of this century and condemned by the UN as a “disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history”. The United Nations has asked for more than $5 billion in humanitarian aid this year for Syria, its biggest financial appeal ever for a single crisis. But amidst politically-charged debates on the use of chemical weapons, military drone strikes and UN intervention, the real victims of the Syrian civil war, its refugees and its children, are slowly being relegated to the background. It is becoming a political issue, rather than a human one. The number of refugees fleeing over the Syrian borders to Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq to escape the violent conflict reached 2 million. Currently, it is estimated that over 2.5 million persons have fled the conflict, more than half of whom are believed to be children. The UN confirmed that thousands of new refugees had fled to Lebanon to escape fighting in the Qalamoun mountains on the Lebanese border. Many of these refugees are families, arriving with only the clothes on their back. The Syrian conflict is the greatest humanitarian crisis of our time in terms of brutality, numbers affected and the impact on children. With no resolution in sight, there is the potential for an entire generation of Syrian children to be deprived of access to a permanent home, formal education and basic health needs. The impact of this will reverberate not only for generations of Syrians to come, but will also be felt in those neighbouring countries who have openly accepted victims of war seeking refuge, and whose own services now face severe stress. For many children however, after having already missed two years of schooling in Syria, attending school is simply too difficult. Some are set to work in order to sustain their families, and girls in particular often stay in the makeshift settlements to care for younger children. The gains made in female education in Syria in the past are regressing as a result of the refugee crisis. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by the magnitude of the Syrian refugee crisis. It is, after all, the biggest humanitarian crisis in modern history with nearly 4 million Syrians one million of them children forced out of their country by the civil war. But, with the conflict and its impact expected to drag on for years, the aid agencies must also plan for the longer term. This includes building capacity in neighbouring states, as the World Bank is doing in Jordan and Lebanon, to provide services for refugees. The life of internally displaced persons (IDPs) is not better then the refugees who have crossed into the neighbouring countries they often find refuge in the poorest and most marginalized regions of the country, which frequently lack proper infrastructure to deal with the population influx. But they are often even harder to reach, as many remain in conflict areas. Staying with relatives or in abandoned properties moving through fields and along roads. And always they are stalked by the bitter war that has torn this country apart the past three years claiming about 126,000 lives, laying waste to infrastructure, and threatening to ignite a broader, regional confrontation. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates  that some 4.5 million Syrians have been displaced within Syria’s borders as the country’s internecine conflict grinds on, exacting its brutal toll. IDPs have often been the invisible and forgotten victims of this brutal conflict and are largely sidelined by the political wrangling between all parties to the conflict and their international backers. Fears continue to mount that Syria’s internally displaced will go hungry with aid agencies unable to reach many in need because of security risks. Moreover measles and acute diarrhea cases are increasing, and WHO has warned the likelihood of outbreaks of water-borne diseases typhoid, cholera and hepatitis among IDP. The United Nation estimates that 2.5 million civilians lack food, water, and medicines, because some towns and villages are too hard to reach, with an estimated 250,000 people completely cut off from outside help. Only 60% of aid pledges have come in, with only a fraction actually reaching the intended beneficiaries. Although some agencies have been able to get aid supplies across national borders, they cannot get through the front lines of the fighting to reach those caught in the crossfire. In a nutshell we can just say that humanity is dying in Syria and the whole world community should do something to save it. International diplomatic efforts must therefore focus on achieving temporary ceasefires to bring in the most urgently needed help, such as polio vaccines for children as new cases of polio is being registered among the refugees. Aid should not be a mere side show to the seemingly endless peace talks taking place in Geneva. In order to ensure that an entire generation of Syrian children is not lost to history, we must pay attention to the issues before us for longer than the headlines. We must continue to support these victims of war for longer than a cake stall. We must keep giving, until the light at the end of the tunnel finally appears. Acting now, rather than waiting for a political solution, is a must. Resettlement of more Syrian refugees through a greater humanitarian intake, combined with a continued public giving program is the only way forward.

8049,NOT_STRIKE,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has appointed Mohammad Akram Qureshi as special prosecutor to oppose appeals against the conviction of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam and son-in-law retired Capt Mohammad Safdar.  Mr Akram Qureshi is a former additional judge of the Lahore High Court and was among those judges who took oath  under the Provisional Constitutional Order after the 2007 emergency proclaimed by former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf.  As the Islamabad High Court (IHC) bench comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb was formulating a strategy for expeditious disposal of the pending petitions seeking suspension of sentence against Mr Sharif, Ms Maryam and Capt Safdar, advocate Qureshi tried to drag the case to the next week.  At the outset, Khawaja Haris Ahmed, counsel for Nawaz Sharif, requested the court to decide the pending petitions first before taking up the appeals against the conviction.  He was of the view that since the Supreme Court has ordered that the pending trial against Mr Sharif in Al-Azizia and Flagship Investment references be concluded in six weeks, it was not possible for him to argue in the accountability court and the high court simultaneously.   Khawaja Haris requests court to decide pending petitions before taking up appeals   He pointed out that since the evidence in all three references — Avenfield properties, Al-Azizia and Flagship Investment — was the same any observation of the IHC regarding it during the course of hearing of the appeals would affect the trial.  Advocate Qureshi argued that NAB wanted to produce the relevant orders of the Supreme Court regarding the similar evidence and said that the apex court had rejected the appeals of the Sharif family seeking clubbing of the three references on this ground.  Justice Minallah remarked: “We don’t want to delay this; Khawaja Haris sahib will argue his case till Wednesday and then NAB will start its arguments, in the meanwhile they [NAB] may file the relevant record.”  The prosecutor on the other hand expressed inability to present the record before Monday and suggested that the proceedings might be adjourned till next week since the bureau would obtain the certified copies of relevant court orders from the Supreme Court.  “You know this statement badly affects the reputation of your organisation,” pointed out Justice Aurangzeb as the prosecutor apparently tried to drag the court proceedings.  But Justice Minallah resolved the issue by allowing NAB to file the required documents by next Monday. The judge, however, advised Khawaja Haris to confine his arguments to the facts other than included in the evidence.  “It had been heard at length. There are some other questions for the defence counsel, since the scope of Section 426 of the Criminal Procedure Code is limited. It is not a case of bail. We cannot discuss evidence,” reminded Justice Minallah.  Khawaja Haris replied that he would try to establish the case without touching the evidence. “I will start my arguments from tomorrow,” he said.  The court directed both the prosecutor and the defence counsel to submit synopsis of their arguments by Wednesday and adjourned proceedings till Tuesday.  The court also warned NAB that in case it failed to submit the documents by Monday, the court would decide the case without any further delay.  President of the Pakistan Muslim League-N Shahbaz Sharif, Ayaz Sadiq, Marriyum Aurangzeb and other party leaders witnessed the IHC hearing.  Meanwhile, defence counsel Khawaja Haris continued cross-examination of star prosecution witness Wajid Zia in the accountability court on Monday.  During the cross-examination, Mr Zia who headed the JIT in the Panama Papers case testified that except an unattested source document, there was nothing on record which mentioned  the Hill Metal Establishment (HME) as a corporate entity.  Referring to another document regarding registration of the HME, the witness informed the court that document showed that it was the sole proprietorship owned by Hussain Nawaz and was established in 2005.  He said the HME’s registration certificate was received after a request for mutual legal assistance was sent to Saudi Arabia.

14053,NOT_STRIKE,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vucic announced the arrest of the mayor of a Belgrade suburb on Friday in connection with an attack on a journalist that has become a cause for protesters during nearly two months of anti-government demonstrations. Vucic, a former ultra-nationalist who has become an advocate of closer ties with the West, is facing weekly demonstrations from opposition groups that accuse him of increasingly authoritarian rule. More protests are planned for Saturday. Opposition parties and their backers accuse Vucic and his  Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of stifling media freedoms and carrying out attacks on political opponents and journalists. Demonstrators have been angered in particular by a firebomb attack on the home of a journalist, Milan Jovanovic, in Belgrade’s suburb of Grocka last month. The attackers hurled a firebomb at a car in the garage and fired a pistol at the door as the house burned. The reporter escaped from a rear window. Jovanovic says he was targeted over his reporting about corruption in his municipality. In a televised address, Vucic said Grocka’s mayor, who is also an official in the SNS party, had been taken for questioning over his role in the attack on the reporter’s home. “A party membership card will not save anyone from responsibility. Journalists will be protected no matter for whom they work for ... No one will be protected because of being a politician,” Vucic said. He also pledged a tougher fight against politically motivated violence and cronyism, including changes in the legislature. Serbia wants to join the EU, tentatively by 2025, but to do so it must first root out corruption, organised crime, nepotism and red tape. Earlier this week, at a panel during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Vucic said he was dissatisfied with media freedoms in Serbia and pledged to make an effort to help improve them.

3418,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — As bad as President Donald Trump describes U.S.-Pakistani ties today, they can get far worse.  Over 16 years that included hundreds of deadly U.S. drone strikes, Osama bin Laden’s killing on Pakistani soil and accusations Pakistan helps insurgents that kill Americans, the reluctant allies never reached one point of no return: Pakistan closing the air routes to Afghanistan.  It’s an action that could all but cripple the U.S.-backed military fight against the Taliban. It could also be tantamount to Pakistan going to war with the United States.  Even if such a step is seen as unlikely by most officials and observers, Pakistan’s ability to shape the destiny of America’s longest war is a reminder of how much leverage the country maintains at a time Trump is suspending hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance.  “There’s some suggestion that we have all of the cards in our hands,” said Richard Olson, a former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan. “But we don’t. The leverage is strong on the Pakistan side as well and arguably stronger than our side.”  Trump’s re-commitment of U.S. forces to the fight in Afghanistan makes the stakes high for his administration. The top U.S. diplomat for South Asia, Alice Wells, made a low-key visit to Islamabad this week, suggesting both sides want to prevent a breach in ties. Pakistan’s cooperation is needed not only to reduce violence in its northern neighbor. It’s also critical to any hope of a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban after decades of conflict.  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said the U.S. doesn’t expect Pakistan to cut off supply routes. Even so, the U.S. is seeking out alternatives, a senior administration official said, without elaborating on what those routes might be. The Pentagon wouldn’t discuss the issue, citing operational security, other than to say military planners develop “multiple supply chain contingencies” to sustain their mission.  The administration official, who wasn’t authorized to comment by name and demanded anonymity, said it would be “very difficult” but not impossible for the U.S. to get military equipment into Afghanistan if the Pakistan route is shut down. Restrictions limit what types of supplies can flow through the Northern Distribution Network in Central Asia, set up during the Obama administration amid concerns about relying solely on Pakistan.  Pakistan has cut overland access before. When a U.S. airstrike killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at the Afghan-Pakistan frontier in late 2011, months after the U.S. commando raid that killed bin Laden, Pakistan blocked border crossings into Afghanistan.  The decision sunk U.S.-Pakistani relations to a post-9/11 low point. Supply trucks that trundle across desert into Afghanistan’s southern Kandahar province or into Nangarhar via the mountainous Khyber Pass ground to a halt. Hundreds of containers shipped from the U.S. or the Gulf were left stranded in the Pakistani port of Karachi until mid-2012.  For the U.S., truck and rail costs inflated by about 50 percent, said David Sedney, a former Pentagon official who organized the alternative northern routes. He said deliveries by air cost three times as much or more.  But the saga, resolved through a U.S. apology, also exposed the limits of Pakistan’s leverage, Sedney said. Pakistan’s own economy was hurt, notably the military-dominated trucking industry. And the Afghan war effort, which was then supporting more than 70,000 U.S. troops, compared with around 16,000 now, endured.  That was perhaps the result of Pakistan never closing the air corridor into Afghanistan, which U.S. pilots call “the boulevard.” It’s essential for ferrying ammunition and weapons for U.S. and Afghan forces, and waging war. U.S. intelligence flights and combat missions use it when taking off from U.S. bases in the Persian Gulf or from aircraft carriers in the Indian Ocean.  Since closing Pakistan’s airspace would hinder America’s ability to defend its forces in Afghanistan, Olson, the former ambassador, said the U.S. might regard such action as a “casus belli,” or grounds for war. Other former U.S. officials echoed that assessment.  “From what I can tell we don’t actually have any serious alternative,” said Daniel Markey, a South Asia expert at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.  Sedney said the Northern Distribution Network, which fell out of use after most U.S. forces were withdrawn from Afghanistan by late 2014, could be restored with astute U.S. diplomacy. Nations such as Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan all have been used before for transporting mostly nonlethal supplies. Poor U.S. relations with Russia could make the task trickier, however. Moscow wields significant influence over these former Soviet states.  Pakistan is weighing options carefully. The suspension of around $1.2 billion in assistance and Trump’s accusations of Pakistani “lies and deceit” for allowing Taliban havens have stirred anger and demands from opposition party leader Imran Khan for both land and air links to be cut.  Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington, Aizaz Chaudhry, indicated such steps weren’t imminent, urging greater U.S. cooperation on counterterrorism. But he warned that further downward spiraling in U.S.-Pakistani ties could create a situation in which “everything will be on table.”  Chaudhry cited Pakistan’s longstanding complaints that its efforts have been unappreciated, claiming that most leaders of the Haqqani network — which the U.S. hopes to eradicate — have fled to Afghanistan. Critics say Pakistan’s military only targets insurgents threatening Pakistan itself.  “The problem is we have a porous open border and it’s like a revolving door,” Chaudhry told The Associated Press. “These elements tend to come back, and travel back and forth, but there is no organized presence or safe havens inside Pakistan.”  Republicans and Democrats in America aren’t sold. Lawmakers have urged targeted financial sanctions against Pakistani intelligence officials linked to militants, and for Pakistan to lose its “non-NATO ally” status that offers preferential access to U.S. military technology. Zalmay Khalilzad, a former U.S. ambassador in Kabul, is among hawks advocating Pakistan be declared a state sponsor of terrorism, unless it cooperates.  But others who’ve worked with the Pakistanis fear coercion could backfire at a time they’re hedging their bets, unsure America will win in Afghanistan.  A tacit Pakistani alliance with the Taliban will appear “more important to them than ever as we turn once again from an ally into an adversary,” said Ryan Crocker, who was U.S. ambassador in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

4098,NOT_STRIKE,"ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has pointed out mismanagement, irregularities and weak financial control of Rs5.8 trillion worth of public money by 44 federal ministries during audit year 2017-18.  The audit objections over accounts of the federal government for 2017-18 are far greater — 87 per cent higher — than those of 36 ministries involving an amount of Rs3.12tr a year before, showing deterioration in financial control over the public money instead of improvement.  Submitted to the president and laid before parliament as required under Article 171 of the Constitution, the AGP put on record that the findings were based on scrutiny of public funds of 44 out of 60 federal ministries and divisions and did not cover amounts below Rs1 million spent or received by these entities. It said that an amount of Rs69.4 billion was recovered and deposited in the federal consolidated fund.   Submitted to president and parliament, report covers year 2017-18   The AGP highlighted a total of 39 cases of weak internal control amounting to Rs5.775tr involving a series of ministries and divisions and related entities abroad. It also pointed out 82 cases of irregular expenditures or payments amounting to Rs24.75bn in violation of rules.  The AGP highlighted 26 cases of weak financial management worth Rs5.77tr and another 22 cases related to unsound asset management amounting to Rs1.3bn. There were 65 cases of recovery amounting to Rs9.12bn, while three cases were reported where record relating to Rs3.18bn was not produced on auditor’s demand.  Interestingly, the AGP also questioned misrepresentation of more than Rs3.89tr worth of supplementary grants by the Ministry of Finance and the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue which are required to ensure sound financial management of the federal government. In violation of Articles 80, 83 and 84 of the Constitution, the finance ministry did not print these supplementary grants which accounted for 92pc of the total supplementary grants, it said.  The AGP reported to the president and parliament that the finance ministry was required to place all supplementary grants before the National Assembly for approval but it was not done and such large amounts remained unreported. The finance ministry’s response that the supplementary grants received from various ministries and divisions beyond a cut-off date could not be made part of the book presented to parliament was found untenable.  Moreover, the AGP noted that the ministries and divisions had incurred an expenditure of Rs1.74tr in excess of final grants available to them and in fact the heads and principal accounting officers of the ministries were not authorised to incur excess expenditure without any supplementary grants or within original budget allocation.  The AGP also expressed concern over the failure of various ministries and divisions to surrender savings worth Rs109.5bn, resulting in lapse of funds. This is violation of financial rules that require that all anticipated savings should be surrendered to the kitty immediately they are foreseen but not later than May 15 each year. This could have pre-empted utilisation of funds by some other deserving areas and was a clear sign of poor financial management.  As if that was not enough, the AGP raised serious objections over the fact that top officers of the finance ministry responsible for prudent fiscal management of the country’s accounts had disbursed among themselves an unapproved amount of Rs10.166m during the audit year 2017-18 and demanded recovery of these funds.  They included 16 officers in Grade-21 and 22 for whom the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had not approved honoraria. They are: Tariq Bajwa, Tariq Pasha, Shahid Mahmood, Dr Waqar Masood, Ghazanfar Abbas Jilani, Noor Ahmed, Naveed Allauddin, Ejaz Wasti, Akbar Sharifzada, Amer Mahmood, Syed Anwar Bukhari, Shujat Ali, Haq Nawaz, Arshad Ahmad, Hafiz Tahir and Aamar Ashraf Khwaja.  The AGP said the ECC had approved an honorarium exceeding one month pay to employees to the level of joint secretaries, but these officers took away Rs10.166m as 3-6 months’ additional salaries.  The audit report also highlighted that five regulatory authorities responsible for regulating the country’s five major sectors of economy were themselves violators of the laws as they did not pay Rs3.12bn to the Competition Commission of Pakistan as 3pc mandatory regulatory fee. The regulatory agencies included the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), Pakistan Telecommunication Authority and Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority.  Moreover, the appointment of Ogra chairperson Uzma Adil Khan was also in conflict of interest and against the laid down rules. The AGP also demanded recovery of Rs955m from the families and guarantors of 132 scholars out of about 3,000 sent abroad on government expense but never returned in violation of their security bonds.

1372,NOT_STRIKE," NAIROBI, Kenya — The U.S. military on Tuesday announced its deadliest airstrike against the al-Shabab extremist group in Somalia in nearly a year, killing about 60 fighters.  The U.S. Africa Command said Friday’s airstrike occurred near the al-Shabab-controlled community of Harardere in Mudug province in the central part of the country. According to its assessment no civilians were injured or killed, the statement said.  It was the largest U.S. airstrike since one on Nov. 21, 2017, killed about 100 al-Shabab fighters. The statement gave no further details about what was targeted, and a U.S. Africa Command spokesman said it was not a camp.  The U.S. military has carried out more than two dozen airstrikes, including drone strikes, this year against the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, the deadliest Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa.      Al-Shabab, which seeks to establish an Islamic state in Somalia, continues to hold parts of the country’s south and central regions after being chased out of Mogadishu several years ago.   Somalia on Sunday marked the first anniversary of al-Shabab’s deadliest attack, a truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed well over 500 people. It was one of the world’s deadliest attacks since 9/11 and the worst extremist attack ever in Africa.  The U.S. Africa Command spokesman said the airstrike had no link to the anniversary.  The United States, which also has targeted a small number of fighters linked to the Islamic State group in northern Somalia, has increased its military presence in the long-chaotic Horn of Africa nation since early 2017 to about 500 personnel after President Donald Trump approved expanded military operations.  Al-Shabab, which seeks to establish an Islamic state in Somalia, continues to hold parts of the country’s south and central regions after being chased out of Mogadishu several years ago. The group, estimated at several thousands of fighters, still carries out deadly attacks against high-profile targets such as hotels and checkpoints in the capital and other cities. It also remains a threat in parts of neighboring Kenya.  While some observers have questioned the effectiveness of airstrikes by the U.S. and Kenya and raised concerns about civilians being killed, the U.S. military maintains that they “reduce al-Shabab’s ability to plot future attacks, disrupt its leadership networks and degrade its freedom of maneuver within the region.”  READ MORE: Somalia sees enemy al-Shabab weaken under U.S. military pressure  Somali forces in the next few years are expected to take over responsibility for the country’s security from an African Union peacekeeping force, which already has started withdrawing hundreds of personnel.  The U.S. says it continues to support that transfer even as some U.S. military officials have joined AU officials and others in expressing concern that Somalia’s forces are not yet ready.

1034,NOT_STRIKE,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.-backed forces have captured Islamic State fighters tied to a January suicide bombing in Syria that killed four Americans, U.S. officials say, generating concrete leads for Washington about the deadliest attack to date there against U.S. personnel. FILE PHOTO:    The casket carrying the remains of Scott Wirtz, a civilian employee of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency killed along with three members of the U.S. military during a recent attack in Syria, sits in a military vehicle during a dignified transfer ceremony as they are returned to the United States at Dover Air Force Base, in Dover, Delaware, U.S., January 19, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo The bombing killed Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan Farmer, Navy Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon Kent and  Scott Wirtz from the Defense Intelligence Agency. It also killed Ghadir Taher, a naturalized U.S. citizen working as a civilian interpreter for a U.S. contractor. One of the officials told Reuters the number of people detained was in the “single digits.” A second official said there were several “initial detentions” made in February, without offering a specific number. The detentions have not been previously reported. “Those initial detentions have provided some leads and opportunities that we are continuing to exploit,” the second official said, speaking on condition of anonymity and declining to offer additional details. “The investigation is ongoing as are efforts to bring all of those terrorists responsible to justice.” The attack was the worst single incident involving U.S. personnel in Syria since they deployed on the ground there in 2015 and took place at a cafe in the town of Manbij, which was controlled by a militia allied to U.S.-backed Kurdish forces. The bombing occurred nearly a month after President Donald Trump confounded his own national security team and allies with a surprise decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, declaring Islamic State had been defeated there. Critics seized on the killings as clear evidence that the Islamic State still posed a threat. Trump backtracked in February, agreeing to leave a small U.S. presence to help keep pressure on Islamic State during what the U.S. military believes will be a critical stabilization phase in Syria. The United States is seeking contributions from allies including Britain and France to remain in Syria. INSURGENCY THREAT The U.S. military has warned that Islamic State may still count tens of thousands of fighters, dispersed throughout Iraq and Syria, with enough leaders and resources to present a menacing insurgency in the months ahead. The Pentagon’s own internal watchdog released a report last month saying Islamic State remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than in Syria. “Absent sustained (counterterrorism) pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to 12 months and regain limited territory,” the report from the Pentagon’s inspector general said. The report, citing information from U.S. Central Command, said Islamic State would portray the withdrawal as a “victory” and conduct attacks on American personnel during the pullout process. A report by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that Islamic State has transformed into a covert network, but is still a threat with centralized leadership, up to $300 million at its disposal and thousands of fighters. It said the group was interested in attacking aviation and using chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials and that there were up to 18,000 Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreign fighters.

31740,NOT_STRIKE,"ISLAMABAD: The Turkey-Pakistan Business Council has called for an early conclusion of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the two countries in order to further improve the flow of trade and promote bilateral investments. The council’s chairman Atilla D. Yerlikaya during a meeting with Board of Investment Chairman Naeem Zamindar on Tuesday, said that the FTA would have a high impact on trade flows as well as bilateral investments. A comprehensive FTA covering commodity and services as well as investments will deepen economic cooperation between the two countries. Mutually agreed exceptions for certain industries can be identified within the scope of a comprehensive agreement, he said. Having significant investments in Pakistan, senior Turkish business representatives from Anadolu Group, Zorlu Holding, Arcelik, Albayrak along with other representatives from health, construction and services industries shared their plans to enhance their investments keeping in view the country’s growth potential. The council operates under the umbrella of Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey (DEIK), a private sector institution, aiming to pave the way for development of Turkey’s economic, commercial, industrial and financial relations with foreign countries and international business communities. He further said that he strongly believed that both business communities have to contribute to these negotiations in order to define the right scope to reduce bilateral trade and investment barriers. The head of Turkish delegation said that DEIK extends cooperation to other countries through the business councils working in 127 countries and is eager to introduce the Turkish business community in Pakistan. Earlier, Mr Zamindar informed the Turkish delegation that the government was encouraging investors to invest in Pakistan, especially in the nine Special Economic Zones (SEZs) identified in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). For upscaling investments and spur industrialisation through creating new industry clusters, SEZ law has been formalised to meet the global challenges of competitiveness. SEZ framework facilitates such parks with liberal incentives, infrastructure and investor assistance services to enhance productivity and reduce the cost of doing business, he explained. He further said that Pakistan offers exemption from custom duties and taxes for all plants and machinery imported into Pakistan as well as income tax holiday for ten years in the SEZs. He invited Turkish investors to invest in all sectors of Pakistan, specifically in agriculture machinery pharmaceutical, mining, to further boost the investment and trade relations between the two countries. He added that Pakistan needs a shift from resource-based and low technology exports to the adoption and development of medium and high-technology productions, and technological sophistication. Almost 80 per cent of Pakistan’s exports are resource-based items, he said.

2068,NOT_STRIKE," When we think of drones, we often first think of the military. Last month, Google decided to not renew a Pentagon contract for an artificial intelligence program that aims to categorize drone strike targets, under pressure from employees who found it unethical.  But a report released by the Foundation for Responsible Robotics in June, called “ Drones in the Service of Society ,” offers a closer look at the potential of drone use in humanitarian aid efforts. “When we have natural disasters, starving people in conflict, or emergency need for medicines, drones can come to the rescue,” said co-author Noel Sharkey .  Drones are being used to deliver blood to hospitals in Rwanda, monitor oil pipelines and fight wildfires in California. Here are other recent ways they’ve helped, too:  1. Delivering to hospitals  Matternet, a Menlo Park, California-based startup, raised $16 million for transporting medical supplies and lab samples between hospitals in California and North Carolina. The company started testing its drone delivery system in Zurich, Switzerland, to fly blood and pathology samples to labs in 2015. In May, the Federal Aviation Administration approved Matternet, among others, to partner with state, local or tribal governments to test unmanned aerial networks in the U.S. [ VentureBeat ]  2. Conserving the environment  Scientists are using drones to track how coral reefs are responding to climate change, where in the past they would have used underwater photography or satellite technology. Meanwhile, Seattle-based DroneSeed is planting seeds in forests, delivering water and spraying herbicides by drone. While in Africa, drones are authorities’ eyes in the sky to deter poachers attempting to traffic animals. [ Geospacial World ]  3. Finding landmines  Researchers at Binghamton University developed a way for drones to find small “butterfly” landmines that are usually hard to detect. The drones are equipped with infrared cameras that can identify the mines by their shape and temperature: the mines heat up much faster than surrounding rocks. “We believe our method holds great potential for eventual widespread use in post-conflict countries, as it increases detection accuracy and allows for rapid wide-area assessment without the need for an operator to come into contact, or even proximity of the minefield,” said Alex Nikulin, assistant professor of energy geophysics. [ Phys.org ]  4. Monitoring volcanoes to improve warning times  Following the eruption of Kilauea in Hawaii, volcanologists at the U.S. Geological Survey used drones to plot lava flows , formulate models of the changing landscapes and record gases. Volcanic activity is difficult to predict – “Every volcano has its own kind of personality,” says volcanologist Janine Krippner – but information from the drones can help, such as monitoring spikes in gas emitted from the volcano, a possible precursor to eruptions. [ NOVA Next ]  5. Detecting viruses in whales  Scientists are using drones to collect the mist emitted from the blowholes of humpback whales , instead of the more unwieldy method of following the whales by boat and trying to capture the mist with long poles.

They said that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has increased property value and government should also reduce tax on trade of property from the existing 2 per cent to 1pc for non-filers and from 1pc to 0.5pc for filers.  The speakers suggested the State Bank of Pakistan to remove ban on advance payments on imports which are negatively affecting business activities in the country. The business community of Islamabad also maintained that government should impose tax on profits instead of imposing them on revenues.  They said the FBR also needs to streamline its audit process and conduct audits every 3-5 years.  President ICCI Ahmed Hassan Moughal, presiding over the session, said that the complicated tax system is a major hurdle in promoting tax culture and improving tax revenues.  While Rafat Farid, senior vice president ICCI, said that the tax difference between the federal and provincial levels has created unnecessary hurdles for the business community and emphasised that government should introduce a uniform tax system across the country.

1203,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is calling for an urgent halt to the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen and the start of negotiations in November toward a political settlement.  The renewed push for a political solution in Yemen comes amid growing criticism of U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia’s Yemen air campaign in the aftermath of the killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Turkey.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged a cease-fire, specifically citing missile and drone strikes into Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The Houthis are supported by Iran. He added the airstrikes by the Arab coalition, backed by the U.S., “must cease in all populated areas in Yemen.”  “The time is now for a cessation of hostilities,” Pompeo said in a written statement Tuesday evening shortly after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis made similar statements in an appearance at the United States Institute of Peace.  Mattis was more specific than Pompeo in his call for urgent movement toward a political solution to the fighting. He said a cease-fire should take effect within 30 days.      “We’re calling on all the parties, specifically the Houthis and the Arab coalition, to meet in Sweden in November and to come to a solution.”   “We’re calling on all the parties, specifically the Houthis and the Arab coalition, to meet in Sweden in November and to come to a solution,” Mattis said.  Sweden’s foreign minister said Wednesday that Griffiths has asked Sweden to host such talks.  Mattis called for demilitarization of Yemen’s border with Saudi Arabia “so that the Saudis and the Emirates do not have to worry about missiles coming into their homes and cities and airports.” He also said measures should be taken to “ensure that all Iranian-supplied missiles to the Houthis” are put under “international watch.”  Mattis put primary blame on Iran. He said its proxies and surrogate forces are fueling the conflict.  “They need to knock it off,” he said.  The conflict in Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis, who toppled the internationally recognized government. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.

32144,NOT_STRIKE,"The 1947 Partition of India took place as a consequence of growing violence and tensions between the region’s Hindu majority and Muslim minority. But the constitutions of the two countries that came into being due to Partition — i.e. Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan — were largely woven from elements of what is called civic-nationalism. Civic nationalism aims to construct a political identity on the basis of shared values such as civil rights; and a shared respect for democratic and state institutions. Civic nationalism celebrates multiculturalism and ethnic, religious and sectarian diversity. But its implementation is only possible if this diversity adopts a political and national identity based on mutual economic, political and social goals — goals not driven by the interests of any one particular ethnic or religious group. It is true that the 1956, 1962 and 1973 constitutions of Pakistan highlight the fact that Pakistan was a Muslim-majority country in which no laws that are “repugnant” to the faith’s scriptures would be legislated. It is also correct that from 1974 onward, the 1973 constitution had been constantly amended — so much so, that by the early 1990s its civic-nationalist tenor had been replaced by a rather narrow version of so-called “Islamic nationalism.”  The fall of the Muslim modernism project in Pakistan is tied to the mutilation of the constitution  The 1956 and 1973 constitutions declared Pakistan to be an “Islamic Republic.” So how could they have been civic-nationalist in nature? This question often attracts some rather interesting answers. And even more interesting is the fact that the roots of these answers often lie in the 1962 constitution, which, initially, had actually changed the country’s name to “Republic of Pakistan.” Also, this constitution was authored and passed by a parliament dominated by the members of an authoritarian government (Ayub Khan). To push through certain social and economic reforms which the religious parties had deemed “secular” and “anti-Islam,” Ayub inducted the services of some well-known “modernist” Islamic scholars such as Ghulam Ahmad Parvez and Dr Fazal Rehman Malik and to a certain extent Justice Javed Iqbal, son of Muhamad Allama Iqbal. With their input the Ayub regime created a narrative which emphasised that pre-partition Muslim scholars such as Syed Ahmad Khan, Muslim nationalist philosopher and poet Muhammad Allama Iqbal, and Pakistan’s founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah, all advocated a reformed, progressive and modernist strand of Islam. According to the narrative, Islam was inherently progressive, inclusive and had preempted concepts such as pluralism, and political and economic modernity long before they were adopted by the secular West. So those Pakistani politicians and intellectuals who describe the 1956 and 1973 constitutions as being civic-nationalist in nature do so by pointing out that an “Islamic Republic” has an inherent spirit of civic-nationalism because Islam in essence is democratic, progressive, inclusive and pluralistic. Of course, as mentioned earlier, this is perhaps no more the case due to the many amendments to the 1973 constitution between 1974 and the early 1990s. It had been a consensual deed whose initial intent was to construct a modernist, inclusive and progressive Islamic republic. But it eventually became a document which began to eschew these values, if not entirely enshrine certain disconcerting aspects of bigotry and religious segregation.     During the Ayub regime (1958-69), a colourful poster appeared in the first half of his government. It shows Ayub’s face superimposed on an old painting of the third Mughal emperor Akbar (1556-1605). In his 1971 book The Ayub Khan Era, Lawrence Ziring writes that Ayub was a great admirer of Kamal Ataturk, the modernist Turkish nationalist leader, and Charles De Gaulle, the former French World War II hero and president. There are those who claim that Ayub was also an admirer of Emperor Akbar. But what exactly was the aforementioned poster that was published by his regime in the early 1960s trying to convey? Since the religious parties were hostile towards Ayub’s reforms, the poster might have appeared in 1964 when the regime banned Jamaat-i-Islami, one of its loudest critics. A leading historian, I.H. Qureshi, authored a book The Muslim Community of Indo-Pakistan Subcontinent, in which he had criticised Akbar’s ‘inclusive’ policies which (according to Qureshi) had begun to weaken Muslim rule in India. Ironically, Qureshi was close to the Ayub regime, but his thesis in this respect was immediately picked up by those critical of Ayub’s version of Islam. In 2008, another eminent historian, Dr Mubarak Ali, saw the funny side of this confusion. In 1582, Akbar had tried to formulate a syncretic idea of a universal set of beliefs by fusing together “the best elements” from Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism and Christianity. After Akbar’s death, some Islamic scholars began claiming that Akbar had blasphemed by trying to create his own religious cult. Historians such as Qureshi informed that this so-called creed was called Din-i-Illahi. But in a June 9, 2009 interview published in Dawn, Ali said that Akbar never called it Din-i-Illahi nor explained it as a religion. The misperception about exactly what it constituted was largely proliferated by the faulty translations of the writings of Abu Fazal (one of Akbar’s ministers), by the British in the 19th century. Akbar’s move in this respect was just an extension of the overall Muslim-Mughal ethos of inclusivity which had helped the empire rule over a Hindu majority. So historians such as Qureshi and many others basically used the flawed British translations to form their opinion about Akbar, despite the fact that Qureshi was close to the Ayub  regime which had begun to portray him as a modern-day Akbar. In his quintessential 1967 book Islamic Modernism in India & Pakistan, Aziz Ahmad, an eminent scholar and author, insinuated that such overlapping confusions were at least one of the reasons why the Muslim modernist and civic-nationalist project in Pakistan began to wither away.

1133,NOT_STRIKE," ATAQ, Yemen — Al-Qaida was giving away motorcycles up in the mountains — that’s what the kids in town were saying the day Abdullah disappeared.  Early that morning, Mohsanaa Salem woke her 14-year-old son to go buy vegetables. The sun had just risen above the mountain ridge, and winter light filled the ravine where their mud brick house sat at the foot of a slope. “Let me sleep,” Abdullah groaned from a mattress on the floor, surrounded by his brothers and sisters.  One word from his father, though, and the boy was up and dressed, trudging out of the house to the market in a neighboring village. Three hours later, when he still hadn’t returned, Mohsanaa and her husband began to worry.  They were a family trying to get by in Yemen, a nation at war with itself that has become a battleground for more powerful countries.      They knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive.   They knew that many families like theirs had been caught in the middle, with thousands killed in fighting between Iranian-backed rebels from the north, known as Houthis, and forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition trying to restore the ousted government.  They knew that al-Qaida militants were based in the mountains, sending fighters out to battle the Houthis, while trying to elude missiles fired from U.S. drones that often killed innocents.  And they knew Abdullah was a good boy, though a bit naive. He never strayed far — just to school or to play soccer with his friends in a lot so close his mother could see it from the house. At about 10 a.m., Mohsanaa and her husband called around to the couple dozen other families who lived in their village to ask if anybody had seen Abdullah.  No one had, and his parents’ worry grew to panic.  ___  All around al-Said district, in Yemen’s southern Shabwa province, people heard the American drone overhead on the morning of Jan. 26.  That wasn’t unusual. The sky often buzzed with drones hunting for the moment to strike at the al-Qaida militants, a mix of locals, foreign fighters and Yemenis from other parts of the country who had moved into the district.  From above, the drone surveyed an inhospitable landscape of barren limestone mountains, creased with ravines and gorges. Zooming in on those threads of green, the drone would have scanned dozens of isolated villages like the one where Abdullah lived, each just a few houses above plots of land planted with wheat and animal fodder.  Abdullah’s village, Shaab Arshan, sits in a wadi just over 100 meters (yards) wide in places, the bare mountains rearing up steeply on either side. Ravines and gorges lead to slightly larger valleys that eventually open into desert, the fringes of the vast Empty Quarter that takes up much of the Arabian Peninsula.  Al-Qaida fighters come down to the valleys to resupply and recruit in the markets. They pass out memory cards with their videos and lectures. They show up at weddings or funerals now and then, preaching to those in attendance. And they offer gifts to teens and young men, the most vulnerable and easily swayed to join their ranks.      For more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen.   For more than a decade, the United States has waged a drone war against al-Qaida in Yemen, trying to eliminate one of the most dangerous branches of the terror network. The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes, carrying out more in two years than the Obama administration did over its entire eight years — 176, compared to 154. More than 300 people — militants and civilians — were killed in 2017 and 2018 by one estimate.  At least 30 civilians were killed in 2018, The Associated Press found, based on accounts from family members and witnesses. A few weeks before Abdullah’s disappearance, a drone’s missile slammed into a farm in a neighboring province, killing a 70-year-old man and a young relative who had just returned from mediating a land dispute.  But here in al-Said district, it had been months since the last strike.  ___  Soon after he left the house, Abdullah ran into a schoolmate who told him al-Qaida militants were giving away motorcycles in the town of Mosaynaa. The friend had heard it from a neighbor who belonged to the group.  Abdullah had never thought of joining al-Qaida and he didn’t want to now. He was in the 8th grade and dreamed of becoming a doctor one day. But he knew how to drive, and he wanted a motorcycle.  The boys agreed they would go get the motor bikes and come right home.  They caught a ride to the market in Yashbom, where Abdullah used part of the money his mother had given him to pay for a taxi to Ataq, the provincial capital on the other side of the mountain.  Abdullah loved Ataq — the closest thing to a city the village boy had seen. His father took him and his siblings there to buy gifts at holiday times and new clothes before the start of school. He always pleaded with his parents to send him to school there as a reward if he made it to the top of his class.  It was there that his friend had been told to contact the militants who would take them where they needed to go. They had no idea how far away that would be.  ___  Abdullah’s parents expanded their search to nearby villages and called relatives in Ataq. No one had seen their boy.  What if a driver had hit Abdullah and sped away? He could be lying by the side of the road, or maybe someone found him and took him to a hospital.  Abdullah was their miracle child. Mohsanaa had complications in the pregnancy and gave birth to twins after only seven months. Abdullah’s brother died within days, and doctors were sure Abdullah would die, too. He was tiny, hairless, and there were no incubators at the hospital.      “If you saw him, you’d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand.”   “If you saw him, you’d think he was a doll, just the size of the palm of your hand,” Mohsanaa said.  When Mohsanaa brought Abdullah home, she wouldn’t let anyone near him. She fed him formula. She kept him warm by spreading butter over his body and wrapping him in cotton. Every day, he got better, and by six months “he became a normal baby,” she said.  In an impoverished country where nearly four years of civil war have pushed millions to the brink of starvation, the family had much to be thankful for. Abdullah’s father, Saleh bin Elwiya, worked as a taxi driver and made enough to feed his wife, four sons and four daughters.  Saleh was a careful driver, plying the roads all day as far as Aden, southern Yemen’s biggest city, on the coast. He adored his children and had taught all his sons to drive, except for the youngest, Abdel-Salam, who at 8 couldn’t reach the pedals yet.  He always urged Abdullah to focus on his schoolwork.  “You just study, and I will take care of everything else,” Saleh told him. “I don’t want you to end up a taxi driver like I did because I didn’t finish school.”  Now his boy had vanished.  Saleh’s eldest son, Zayad, and a brother-in-law, Nabil, drove out to search the roads. The two were in the army together, on a week’s leave from a front-line unit fighting the Houthi rebels. At every army checkpoint along the way, they described Abdullah to the soldiers, asking if they’d seen him: A tall, lanky boy, baby face, not a trace of whiskers?  Finally, a soldier outside Ataq said yes. He’d seen him passing in a car. It was welcome news: At least they knew Abdullah had made it this far.      “Things happen at night.”   Saleh headed for Ataq in his taxi. There, he joined his relatives, searching in the markets and at taxi stands, going street by street, alley by alley through the city. He spoke little, growing more tense with every futile turn.  As night fell, they gathered at the home of Saleh’s brother in the Russian Compound, a housing complex on the city’s edge, built in the 1980s when Soviet experts were here searching for oil. Zayad called his mother. Still nothing, he told her.  Mohsanaa told him to stay there and wait until morning to resume the search. She didn’t want them driving around in the dark.  “Things happen at night,” she said.  ___  On the outskirts of Ataq, Abdullah and his friend met a militant, who drove them in a Land Cruiser along a desert highway to Mosaynaa, through an area where Abdullah had never been before. He realized he had been gone for a long time and hadn’t told his parents where he was. He thought about turning back but didn’t have the nerve to say anything.  They passed through Mosaynaa, and the car wove up into the mountains to the al-Qaida fighters’ camp. In a tent, they all had a meal of chicken and rice and Pepsi, but there were no motorcycles. It was too late to leave, so they would have to stay the night. The militants gave the boys a phone to send a message to their parents, and Abdullah texted his father: “I am with al-Qaida. I’ll come back tomorrow. Don’t come for me.”  The boys were offered a tent, but decided to sleep in a nearby crevasse, under some trees. They were worried about airstrikes.  ___  When he received the message in Ataq, Abdullah’s father tried calling back to the militant’s phone. It was turned off. They had to move right away, Saleh told his relatives, or else “I won’t be able to get him back.” Once in al-Qaida’s hands, Abdullah would be gone forever, sent to fight the Houthis or strapped with a suicide belt — or he might be hit by a drone.  With al-Qaida, “all roads lead to death,” said one of Saleh’s nephews.  Despite his wife’s warnings, Saleh got back into the taxi and drove into the night, joined by Zayad and Nabil, along with two of Saleh’s nephews who offered to help.  The search party asked around the shops and eateries still open in the markets. They learned that the boys had been there hours earlier, heading for the mountains.      With al-Qaida, “all roads lead to death.”   Saleh had never been to Mosaynaa and didn’t have the tribal links needed to find his son. He needed local help, so he went to one of the few families he knew, the al-Tolsi family.  The al-Tolsi brothers were beekeepers, a common trade in Yemen, a country known for its honey. One of the brothers had links to al-Qaida, but he wasn’t there when Saleh and his relatives appeared at the door of the family house. Instead, it was another brother, named Mubarak.  Mubarak was not connected to al-Qaida and had status in the community, working as the imam at the local mosque and performing the daily call to prayer. He welcomed the men in and offered them dinner. Over the meal, his guests explained why they had come. Mubarak said he was happy to take them to the mountains in the morning. It was too dark now. But Saleh was insistent.  Mubarak gave in. The beekeeper and his nephew, Naguib, a geology student at a local oil university, joined them, setting out at 10 p.m. At the foot of the mountains, they sought out a local man known to be a look-out for al-Qaida. He belonged to the same tribe as Mubarak, so they knew they could ask him to take a message to the militants: There is a man here who wants his son back.  As the look-out went up the mountain, the seven of them waited below in Saleh’s taxi.  ___  At around 11:30 p.m., an operator pressed a button in a U.S. military base — perhaps in neighboring Saudi Arabia, perhaps as far away as Nevada or Georgia — launching two Hellfire missiles from a drone cruising above the mountain. Abdullah heard explosions in the valley and, terrified, started to cry.  The hours passed slowly to daybreak, when Abdullah and his friend made their way down the mountain. Part way down, they saw a mangled car below. At the bottom, Abdullah recognized the license plate: His father’s taxi.  The missiles had reduced the car to burned wreckage. Abdullah’s father and brother and the other five people inside were torn to pieces.  There were no bodies. Overnight, militants had rushed to the site and taken the remains to Mosaynaa, but their blood was everywhere.  “It was shocking. I wept,” Abdullah said. “I realized he had come looking for me.”  ____  News of the deaths in a drone strike fanned out across the district, passed by WhatsApp messages and phone calls.  One of Mubarak’s brothers, Ahmed al-Tolsi, was away in the neighboring province of Marib, taking their bees to flowers there. He got a message and rushed home to Mosaynaa to bury his kin.  “He is a generous man who received this family, gave them dinner and told them he would help them bring back their child,” he said of Mubarak. “He was doing something good and got killed.”  In Ataq, one of Saleh’s nephews heard a knock on the door at dawn. “Your brothers and uncle are in God’s embrace,” a neighbor said.  The remains of Saleh and his relatives were taken to the town of Yashbom, where Abdullah’s odyssey began, and laid out under sheets in the mosque. Saleh’s legs were gone; Zayad’s body was cut in half.  In keeping with Muslim custom, the five were buried right away in the Yashbom cemetery.  Abdullah’s mother woke at dawn for morning prayers, still worrying about Abdullah. At 7:30 a.m., neighbors arrived dressed in black for mourning and told her the news: Saleh and the others had been hit by the drone. They were all dead.  “It’s not possible. We talked in the evening,” Mohsanaa said. “I told them not to go out at night.”  She was terrified that Abdullah had been killed as well.  Then Abdullah appeared. He had walked four hours to get home and found the crowd of mourners gathered at his house. He sat alone under a tree nearby, trembling, afraid he would be blamed, until the men went over and reassured him. Mohsanaa had her son sit beside her and placed her hands on his head.  Tribal leaders sent emissaries to the al-Qaida fighters to demand they leave the area. But months later, Abdullah still blamed himself, not al-Qaida or the U.S.  “It was my all mistake,” Abdullah said. He speaks in short, muddled sentences, stooped over and looking down at his fingers.      “I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.”   “I was the reason why my father and brother, my uncle and cousins all died.”  The Pentagon confirmed that it carried out a strike in Shabwa province on Jan. 26, saying it was targeting al-Qaida. It does not release details or death tolls in drone strikes, spokeswoman Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich said.  Ever since, the families have tried to prove their slain loved ones were not militants. They gathered letters from everyone they could — police officers, district officials, tribal leaders, school principals — certifying that their relatives did not belong to al-Qaida. They spoke to human rights groups and the International Committee of the Red Cross, asking for an investigation.  They even held a demonstration in Ataq, attended by some 200 people, reading out a statement demanding the U.S. acknowledge that the victims were not al-Qaida and pay compensation to the families.  Their voices have not been heard. The U.S military has an official mechanism for families to request compensation for relatives mistakenly killed — a few families in Iraq and Pakistan have succeeded — but there is no U.S. Embassy in Yemen, so there is nowhere for Saleh’s family to submit evidence that they were civilians.  Abdullah’s family has shards of the missiles that killed the seven men. They keep the shrapnel printed with serial numbers wrapped in a blanket hoping one day to present it as evidence in an investigation.  Mohsanaa doesn’t believe she’ll ever see justice for the killing. With her husband gone, she scrapes by on a meager pension and tries to manage her family’s grief. She doesn’t speak of the killing in front of Abdullah. A pious woman, she knows he mustn’t blame himself.  “This is God’s verdict. If it wasn’t written, they wouldn’t have gone,” Mohsanaa said. “What’s the child’s guilt? He is a victim. He’s a poor boy.”  ___  This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting . Associated Press writer Lee Keath in Cairo contributed.

The Afghan defense officials dismissed the skills endorsement by Sami-ul-Haq and said the Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada is neither a religious cleric nor he has skills in military. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Dawlat Waziri said Mullah Akhundzada would not kill the civilians if he was a military expert and had religious knowledge. Sami-ul-Haq warned that Afghanistan would see a surge in violence following the ascension of new Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah. “Those who think that Haibatullah is a mere cleric and a seminary preacher will soon bear witness to his skill as a militant commander,” he told Dawn after a Defence of Pakistan Council (DPC) meeting in the capital on Monday. He blamed the United States for the persistent violence and said “It was America that resorted to violence again; the assassination of Mullah Mansour is nothing short of murder.” Mullah Mansoor was killed in a drone strike in Balochistan province of Pakistan last month as he was travelling reportedly from Iran. The Taliban group announced the appointment of Mullah Akhundzada as its new chief shortly after the death of Mullah Mansoor was confirmed.

23717,NOT_STRIKE,"IS it shocking or the new normal? Former military dictator and army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf has expressed his admiration and support for Hafiz Saeed and the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba . Unprovoked, seemingly for no reason other than his need to make headlines with increasingly outrageous statements and with no regard for Pakistan’s delicate international position, Mr Musharraf has once again spewed out fantastical nonsense. What is more than puzzling is that when Mr Musharraf was army chief and had installed himself as a military dictator, it was his regime that took significant steps to restrain militancy. Indeed, it was on the former dictator’s orders that many militants groups were outlawed and at least nominal clampdowns enforced. Quite why Mr Musharraf has felt the need to traverse the ground between an advocate of a moderate Pakistan to now saying virtually anything that appears to pop in his mind or interviewers goad him into saying is not clear. What is clear is that his former institution or whoever is able to counsel restraint needs to urgently speak to Mr Musharraf and put an end to his unpredictable outbursts. Perhaps Mr Musharraf also needs to be reminded of the destructiveness of his regime. After nearly a decade in charge, militants were rampant, the economy had tanked and society was under the influence of growing extremism. If there is a singular justification for why modern Pakistan needs democracy not dictatorship, Mr Musharraf is it. Unable to deal with his ouster after a revolt by Pakistani society, Mr Musharraf has tried to establish himself as a legitimate political alternative to no avail. Now, he has chosen self-exile rather than facing a treason trial. But even by the standards of a frustrated former strongman, Mr Musharraf appears to have little regard for the damage his comments can cause to the country. If a long-term army chief and military dictator cannot exercise restraint, perhaps it is time for him to be ignored all together by the nation.

379,NOT_STRIKE,"(Reuters) - Yemen’s warring parties have failed to leave the main port city of Hodeidah three months after agreeing to a breakthrough U.N.-led truce deal as part of efforts to end a four-year-old war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine. The following is a timeline of the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country’s slide into violence and how the conflict has developed. - 1990. Unification of north and south Yemen to form a single state under president Ali Abdullah Saleh. - 1994. Civil war in which Saleh prevents south, angered by what it sees as its lower status, from splitting with north. - 2003-09. Houthi group in north protests marginalisation of the local Zaydi Shi’ite Muslim sect and fights six wars with Saleh’s forces and one with Saudi Arabia. - 2011. Arab Spring protests undermine Saleh’s rule, lead to splits in the army and allow al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to seize swathes of territory in the east. - 2012. Saleh steps down in a political transition plan backed by Gulf states. Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi becomes interim president and oversees a “national dialogue” to draft a more inclusive, federal constitution. - 2013. AQAP survives military onslaught and drone strikes, staging attacks across the country while retaining a persistent presence. Saleh and his allies undermine the political transition. - 2014. The Houthis rapidly advance south from Saadeh and seize Sanaa on September 21 with help from Saleh. They demand a share in power. - 2015. Hadi tries to announce a new federal constitution opposed by the Iran-aligned Houthis and Saleh, who arrest him. He escapes, pursued by the Houthis, triggering Saudi intervention in March along with a hastily assembled Arab military coalition. Months later the coalition, aiming to restore Hadi’s ousted government, drives the Houthis and Saleh loyalists from Aden in south Yemen and Marib, northeast of Sanaa, but the front lines solidify, setting up years of stalemate. - 2016. AQAP takes advantage of the chaos to establish a mini-state around Mukalla in east Yemen, raising fears the war will lead to a new surge in jihadist activity. The UAE backs local forces in a battle that ends the group’s rule there. Hunger grows as the coalition imposes a partial blockade on Yemen, accusing Iran of smuggling missiles to the Houthis through Hodeidah alongside food imports, something it denies. Coalition air strikes that kill civilians prompt warnings from rights groups, but Western support for the military campaign continues. - 2017. The Houthis launch a growing number of missiles deep into Saudi Arabia, including at Riyadh. Seeing a chance to regain power for his family by reneging on his Houthi allies, Saleh switches sides, but is killed trying to escape them. Friction also develops between fighters in Aden backed by Saudi Arabia, and those backed by its Emirati coalition partners. - 2018. Coalition-backed forces, including some flying the southern separatist flag, advance up the Red Sea coast against the Houthis, aiming to take the port of Hodeidah. Hodeidah handles the bulk of Yemen’s commercial and aid imports and is critical for feeding the population of 30 million. Military stalemate ensues: the Houthis control the port and coalition-backed Yemeni forces mass on the outskirts. In the first major breakthrough in peace efforts, the warring parties agree at December talks in Sweden, the first in two years, on a ceasefire and troop withdrawal from Hodeidah. Work on a prisoner swap also begins. -2019. The Stockholm Hodeidah truce largely holds but the withdrawal has yet to materialize amid deep mistrust between the Houthi movement, which controls Hodeidah, and the Saudi-led coalition massed on its outskirts. Violence continues in parts of Yemen outside Hodeidah.

29430,NOT_STRIKE,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey gave a guarded welcome on Wednesday to a U.S. decision to offer millions of dollars to help capture three top Kurdish PKK militants but said Washington must also break its alliance with Kurdish militias in northern Syria. FILE PHOTO: U.S. special envoy for Syria James Jeffrey (R) attends a meeting at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, September 14, 2018. Xu Jinquan/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo Washington pledged up to $5 million for information which could lead to the arrest of PKK military commander Murat Karayilan, and lesser rewards for two other leaders of the group  which has waged an insurgency against Turkey for 34 years. The surprise move followed a series of steps in the last month which have eased a diplomatic crisis between the two NATO allies. However they remain deeply divided, including over U.S. support for Kurdish YPG fighters in north Syria. Turkey says the YPG is indistinguishable from the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara, Washington and the European Union, and demands the United States stop support for the militia - a U.S. ally against Islamic State in Syria. Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said the U.S. rewards offer was a positive but “very, very late” step, and called on Washington to adopt the same policy to the YPG as it did to the PKK. “It is not possible for us to accept putting a bounty on PKK leaders on the one hand, and sending trucks of tools, weapons and ammunition to the YPG on the other,” he told state-owned Anadolu news agency. Turkey’s foreign ministry also said it expected the United States to support the announcement with concrete action in Syria and Iraq “against the PKK and its extensions”. Turkey has regularly launched cross-border strikes into northern Iraq, targeting what it says are PKK bases near the group’s Qandil mountains stronghold. In Syria, where Turkey has conducted two military incursions into the northwest since 2016, President Tayyip Erdogan has also threatened to extend operations in northeastern border regions where YPG forces operate. He issued a “final warning” two weeks ago to anyone he said was endangering Turkey’s border. THREAT TO TURKEY More than 40,000 people have been killed since the PKK launched its insurgency in Turkey in 1984. Turkish defence analyst Can Kasapoglu said the U.S. move suggested Washington had started to see that the presence of the Kurdish militia in Syria was a national security threat “to the extent of survival for Turkey”. However, the United States would expect something in return from Turkey, he said, despite Ankara’s rejection of any step that would legitimise the YPG. Washington’s special representative for Syria told reporters that the United States understood Turkish concerns about links between the PKK and YPG. “We are at pains to reassure Turkey that we will do everything we can that there is ... no concrete security threat coming out of the north against Turkey,” James Jeffrey said. Jeffrey said the United States was limiting “very very carefully” the weapons it was giving to the YPG-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces battling Islamic State militants. “We give them only light weapons. That’s one reason why they have not been as successful recently against Daesh (Islamic State) as they have been in the past. They do not have tanks, they do not have artillery, we do not give them such heavy weapons.” FILE PHOTO: Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan addresses members of parliament from his AK Party (AKP) in Ankara, Turkey, October 23, 2018. REUTERS/Tumay Berkin/File Photo Strained ties between Turkey and the United States have eased slightly in the last month. The two countries lifted mutual sanctions against top officials after a Turkish court freed a U.S. evangelical pastor in October. Washington announced this week that Turkey would receive a temporary waiver from oil sanctions reimposed on Iran, and Erdogan said talks on a possible U.S. fine against state-owned Halkbank over allegations of Iran sanctions evasion were on a positive track. U.S. and Turkish troops last week began joint patrols in northern Syria’s Manbij area after months of delay, and U.S. President Donald Trump and Erdogan are to meet this weekend at a summit in Paris.

2937,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — The White House says the U.S. military mission to eradicate the Islamic State in Syria is coming to a “rapid end” but offers no timetable for withdrawal.  White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Wednesday that the U.S. and its partners remain committed to eliminating the small Islamic State group presence that continues in Syria.  President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants to bring troops home to start rebuilding the U.S. His national security team had advised him against a hasty withdrawal even after made his preference clear: “I want to get out.”  Trump’s director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, told reporters Wednesday that the White House would announce a decision about America’s military involvement in the war-torn country “relatively soon.” Coats said national security officials held an “all-hands-on deck” meeting Tuesday and “some decisions were made.”  Trump said he expected to decide “very quickly” whether to remove U.S. forces, saying their primary mission was to defeat the Islamic State group. “We’ve almost completed that task,” he said.  Trump’s comments to reporters at the White House on Tuesday conflicted with views of his military advisers , some of who spoke at a separate event in Washington about the need to stay in Iraq and Syria to finish off the militant group that once controlled large swaths of territory in both countries.  At a news conference with the leaders of the Baltic nations, Trump was asked whether he still favored pulling U.S. troops out of Syria.  “As far as Syria is concerned, our primary mission in terms of that was getting rid of ISIS,” Trump answered, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. “We’ve completed that task and we’ll be making a decision very quickly, in coordination with others in the area, as to what we will do.”  The mission is “very costly for our country and it helps other countries a helluva lot more than it helps us,” Trump said.  “I want to get out. I want to bring our troops back home. I want to start rebuilding our nation,” he said.  Trump later met with his national security team to discuss Syria.  According to officials familiar with the preparations for the meeting, that team, including CIA chief Mike Pompeo, who has been nominated to be secretary of state, strongly advised against a hasty withdrawal from Syria. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal talks.  Also on the meeting agenda was the fate of some $200 million in U.S. stabilization assistance for Syria that the White House put on hold after Trump said last week that he wanted to leave Syria “very soon.” The State Department was to have spent the money on building up the country’s infrastructure, including power, water and roads.  “As far as Syria is concerned, our primary mission in terms of that was getting rid of ISIS”  Trump in recent weeks has asked Saudi Arabia to contribute $4 billion for reconstruction in Syria, according to a U.S. official, as part of the president’s effort to get other countries to pay for stabilizing the country so the U.S. isn’t on the hook. The United States is awaiting a response from the Saudis, said the official, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the conversations publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  A senior Syrian Kurdish official said Trump’s comments on wanting to withdraw from Syria came at an “inappropriate time” as Islamic State militants re-emerge in eastern Syria and amid threats from Turkey.  The main IS holdout in Syria is in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, where momentum by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces has stalled in recent weeks as many Kurdish members of the group have shifted west to the Afrin area to fight Turkish forces. Pentagon officials have publicly raised the prospect of this giving the IS group the breathing room it needs to regroup.  Many have warned that a premature U.S. withdrawal from Syria would cede the country to Iran and Russia, which have supported Syrian President Bashar Assad. Iran’s continued presence in Syria is especially troubling to neighboring Israel, a U.S. ally that regards Iran as an existential threat.  Some high-ranking Trump administration officials urged caution.  Gen. Joseph Votel told a conference at the United States Institute of Peace that the United States would have to continue its work against remnants of IS in eastern Syria. Votel is commander of U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations across the Middle East, including Syria.  Votel said the military campaign has been largely successful but is not over.  “The hard part, I think, is in front of us, and that is stabilizing these areas, consolidating our gains, getting people back into their homes, addressing the long-term issues” such as reconstruction. “There is a military role in this, certainly in the stabilization phase.”  Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann, Matthew Lee, Josh Lederman and Robert Burns in Washington and Sarah El Deeb in Qamishli, Syria, contributed to this report.

Some of the CPEC-related projects facing litigations, including Thakot-Havelian, Hakla-DIK, E-35 Havelian Abbottabad. Some other mage litigations are: Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway (M1), Islamabad-Lahore Motorway (M-2), Faialabad-Khanewal (M-4) and Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway (M-(9). It has been learnt that more than 150 mega cases was being dealt by a cell called Dispute Resolution Cell (DRC) of the NHA headed by Senior Procurement & Contract Specialist retired Col Muhammad Azim.  Documents reveal alleged mass-scale irregularities and controversial award of contracts  Mr Azim, who has been serving the NHA since 2003, was re-appointed on Jan 7, 2011 for a period of one year and recently he has also been given extension of three months. For the first time ever highest 389 printed audit paras drafted by none other but the Director General Audit (Works) against NHA for alleged irregularities in day to day affairs of the authority. The audit report has also pointed out that the alleged irregular award of a contract at higher rates in NHA caused a loss of Rs166.174 billion, irregular award of contract in violation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and bidding documents — Rs 148.654bn, issuance of works beyond the financial capacity /limit of the insurance companies — Rs39.522bn, irregular award of works — Rs 18.526bn, irregular acceptance of non-responsive bid — Rs17.18bn, irregular award of works without revision of PC-1 — Rs 16.373bn, irregular payment of mobilisation advance due to non-obtaining of required insurance — Rs14.86 million, irregular enhancement in previous agreement — Rs3.005bn, a loss of Rs4.4bn was caused due to late start and non-completion of some projects, an abnormal delay in completion of a flyover project and ineffective site supervision — Rs150m and extra burden of Rs2.6bn on government exchequer due to non-completion of project within the stipulated time period. Controversial appointments It has been learnt that former NHA chairman Shahid Ashraf Tarar was appointed in December, 2013 and mandatory approval of his appointment was given by National Highway Council (NHC) headed by Minister for Communication by virtue of his office before he took over the charge of his office. However, the council’s meeting was chaired by Sheikh Aftab, the incumbent minister for parliament affairs in December, 2013 because the portfolio of the minister communication was held by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. According to the rules Mr Aftab could not chair the meeting and endorse the appointment of Mr Tarar. According to the documents, some of the consultants have been given key positions on the NHA despite the fact that they were considered “outsiders”. Retired Col Salman Rashid is heading NHA Monitoring and Instruction Wing, retired Col Waqar is assisting member finance in day to day affairs and retired Col Musaddaq has been made head of the security on CPEC. Presently 60 deputationists are working with NHA despite stern orders of the Supreme Court that no person could serve on deputation more than three years in any other department. Some of the key office holders on deputation are: Naveed Iqbal Walah (member central zone, Lahore), Abdullah Jan (member south zone, Karachi) Sajjad Ahmed, GM establishment. INTRNTIONAL ARBITRATION ON M-1: One of arbitrations still facing by the NHA is regarding award a contract of Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway to a Turkish based firm called Bayinder Construction Inc (BCI). According to a document, machinery and equipment imported by BCI was given to Jaffar Brothers Limited (JBL) was hired without tendering on heavy cost for evaluation of left over machinery and other equipment, however Pakistan Customs was the competent authority for this job. The financial impact was estimated from Rs5bn to Rs9bn with premature encashment of bank guarantee worth Rs4bn. HUGE DUMP OF EXPLOSIVES: The NHA has no record of huge leftover explosives of BCI based at Burhan camp in 80 rooms full of magazines of detonators, mines and blasting material. It has been learnt that to hide where this material was used, an eyewash committee was formed under the member finance. Award of contracts The authority awarded a number of road projects to a local firm called ZKB allegedly without following rules. However, ex-NHA chairman Mr Tarar said these contracts were awarded after the firm stood lowest in the bidding process. He said NHA could not raise the issue of financial capacity of the firm to execute various projects simultaneously because it always came up with different international firms in joint venture. Replying to Dawn queries regarding litigations, a NHA spokesperson agreed that the authority was facing over 3,000 litigations. Regarding the Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway (M-I), he said BCI, the Turkish contractor, was expelled from M-1 project in 2001 and the NHA was engaged in litigation in three main forums: Bayinder’s cases in local courts, NHA’s encashment of bank guarantees in Turkey and Bayinder’s case in an international court for $746m claim. He claimed that the NHA’s success rate was 100 per cent in this case. Regarding controversial DRC of the NHA, he said DRC made for Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway M-1 project was converted to DRC NHA on Sept 7, 2011, following the approval of NHA legal regulations by the NHA executive board. The spokesperson said the NHA engaged consultants by following PPRA rules in 2010 and thereafter contract was extended for two years terms as per contract law. “There is no age limit restriction for hiring lawyers, doctors and specialists through tendering procedure,” he said. According to the NHA documents, the claims of China International Water and Electric Company (CWE) is amounting to Rs2.74bn plus interest, firm Bina Puri’s claims are about Rs30bn, Daewoo claimed for Rs824m in one case, Bayinder Construction Inc Rs52bn, Rakshani Builders Rs846m, Ayub Brothers Rs407m, firm Interconstruct Rs300m, AM Associates Rs190m, Rustan Dynamic JV Rs200m, etc. Published in Dawn, December 18th, 2017 ",False,2017-12-18 00:00:00+00:00,2019-03-24 01:16:18.562559+00:00,25359,True,3,"NHA facing over 3,000 court cases involving billions of rupees",https://www.dawn.com/news/1377325/nha-facing-over-3000-court-cases-involving-billions-of-rupees

Overall, the full-year toll of civilian deaths in 2012 declined to 2,754, a 12 percent decrease from 3,131 in the same period a year earlier. It was the first time in six years that the civilian death toll dropped.

He also committed to a joint investigation to determine the facts as soon as possible.” The official further added, “The insurgent that we targeted was a known Taliban mid-level commander who has been involved in attacks on ANSF personnel as well as organizing and facilitating lethal aid to insurgents in the area.” President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the airstrike and said that the coalition security forces must immediately stop raids on Afghan homes if United States expects him to sign the bialteral security agreement. Local officials quoted in a statement released by presidential palace said that a child was killed and two women were injured after a coalition forces drone targeted house in Garamser district on Thursday morning. However, the ISAF official said, “We did not target or strike a house. The information that we have shows that the airstrike hit the road, not a house. Unfortunately, the civilian victims were in the vicinity of the strike.” The official also added, “We respect the Afghan people and their homes, and we do not target civilians.” “We make every effort to avoid civilian casualties. Everything possible is done to reduce the risk of collateral injury to the innocent but sometimes we make mistakes. When we do, we fully investigate to identify what went wrong so we can take actions to avoid those mistakes in the future,” the official said.

29339,NOT_STRIKE,"GENEVA/RIYADH (Reuters) - Yemen’s first round of peace talks in almost three years aims to build confidence between the warring sides, U.N. mediator Martin Griffiths said on Wednesday, playing down a delay in the arrival of one delegation. Griffiths wants Yemen’s Saudi-backed government and the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement to work towards a deal to end the war, remove foreign forces from Yemeni territory, and establish a national unity government. A Saudi-led coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states backed by Western powers, including the United States and Britain, intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 against the Houthis to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Subsequent peace talks flopped. Since then the humanitarian situation has worsened dramatically, putting 8.4 million people on the brink of starvation, triggering the world’s worst cholera epidemic, and wrecking the already weak economy. Nobody knows how many people have died: the U.N. lost count more than two years ago, after 10,000 civilians were killed. “The people of Yemen ... are desperately in need of a signal of hope. We’d like to think that the work we will do together in these next days will send a flickering signal of hope to them,” Griffiths said, adding that both sides had consistently pressed him for a release of prisoners. Related Coverage Houthis prevented from attending Geneva peace talks - Yemen Houthi TV Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi was “quite impatient for rapid progress”, Griffiths said. The Houthi movement’s al-Masirah TV reported the coalition had prevented the Houthi delegation from flying to Geneva. But Griffiths brushed off the delay, saying it was nothing unusual and he was confident it would be resolved. He told reporters the first stage of talks would focus on how formal peace negotiations would work. The format was flexible and the two delegations did not need to be in the same room, he said. “We need to discover ... what the parties are prepared to do and what they are prepared to prioritise, both in terms of substance, which will come in a later round, and in terms of these confidence building measures,” he said. The U.N. Security Council urged both sides to de-escalate the conflict. Griffiths described the Council’s unity as “a huge asset”, adding that he did not expect a ceasefire but he hoped for no “provocative military events”. Griffiths has already used the prospect of talks to forestall an attack by the Saudi-led coalition on Hodeidah, a port city and Yemen’s main supply line. Slideshow (8 Images) Aid workers say an assault on the port would be a catastrophe, and Griffiths has been in talks with the Houthis to hand control of it to the United Nations. A draft U.N. peace plan seen by Reuters in June calls on the Houthis to give up their ballistic missiles in return for an end to the Saudi-led bombing campaign and a transitional governance agreement. Anwar Gargash, minister of state for foreign affairs of the United Arab Emirates, part of the Saudi-led coaltion, welcomed the talks. “Long way to go,” he wrote on Twitter. “But Geneva can bring outcome nearer.” Writing by Tom Miles, reporting by Stephen Kalin, additional reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi, Editing by William Maclean Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",False,2018-09-05 00:00:00+00:00,2019-03-24 06:35:05.093935+00:00,29340,True,2,"With Yemen in turmoil, U.N. seeks to build trust as first step towards peace",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-yemen-security-un/with-yemen-in-turmoil-u-n-seeks-to-build-trust-as-first-step-towards-peace-idUKKCN1LL1Z9
3194,NOT_STRIKE," MOSCOW — Russia has tested an array of new strategic nuclear weapons that can’t be intercepted, President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday, marking a technological breakthrough that could dramatically increase Russia’s military capability, boost the Kremlin’s global position and open a new round in the global arms race.  Speaking in a state-of-the-nation speech, Putin said the weapons include a nuclear-powered cruise missile, a nuclear-powered underwater drone and new hypersonic missile that have no equivalent elsewhere in the world. He said the creation of the new weapons has made NATO’s U.S.-led missile defense “useless,” and means an effective end to what he described as Western efforts to stymie Russia’s development.  “I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country’s development: all what you wanted to impede with your policies have already happened,” he said. “You have failed to contain Russia.”      “You have failed to contain Russia.”   The announcement comes as Putin is set to easily win another six-year presidential term in the March 18 election. He said that the nuclear-powered cruise missile tested last fall has a “practically unlimited” range and high speed and maneuverability allowing it to pierce any missile defense.  The Russian leader said the high-speed underwater drone also has an “intercontinental” range and is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could target both aircraft carriers and coastal facilities. He said its operational depth and high speed would make it immune to enemy intercept.  Putin noted that the tests of the compact nuclear reactor to power the new drone were completed last fall.  He added, to applause, that names for the nuclear-powered cruise missile and the drone haven’t yet been chosen, and suggested that the Defense Ministry run a nationwide contest for the best names.  Putin accompanied his statement to an audience of hundreds of senior officials and lawmakers with videos and computer images of new weapons, which were shown on giant screens at a conference hall near the Kremlin.  “No one in the world has anything like that,” he said. “It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.”      “No one in the world has anything like that. It may appear someday, but by that time we will develop something new.”   The Russian leader said that another new weapon called Avangard is an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly to targets at a speed 20 times the speed of sound and strike “like a meteorite, like a fireball.”  Putin said that Russia also tested a new heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, called Sarmat, with a range and number of warheads exceeding its Soviet-era predecessor, known in the West as Satan.  The Russian leader emphasized that the development of new weapons that have no equivalent in the West came in response to the U.S. withdrawal from a Cold war-era treaty banning missile defenses and U.S. efforts to develop a missile defense system.  He said that the U.S. has ignored Russian complaints.  “No one has listened to us,” he said. “You listen to us now.”  He said the new weapons will help ensure global stability and draw a line under attempts to weaken Russia.  He said that another weapons system, called Kinzhal, already has been deployed in Russia’s Southern Military District. He said it’s a hypersonic missile carried by an aircraft that can strike targets 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) away.

2009,NOT_STRIKE," JERUSALEM — The Israeli military lifted its restrictions along the Gaza border Sunday, indicating it had accepted an Egypt-mediated cease-fire that ended a 24-hour round of fighting with Hamas militants that had threatened to devolve into all-out war.  The military had shut down a popular beach and placed limitations on large gatherings as residents kept mostly close to home on Saturday amid dozens of rockets that were fired from Gaza. But after several hours of calm it said residents could resume their daily routines.  On Saturday, the military carried out its largest wave of airstrikes in Gaza since the 2014 war, hitting several Hamas military compounds and flattening a number of its training camps. Two Palestinian teenagers were killed in an airstrike in Gaza City, while four Israelis were wounded from a rocket that landed on a residential home.

Photo by Suhaib Salem/Reuters  The military said several mortar shells were fired even after Hamas announced the cease-fire as sirens warning of incoming projectiles wailed in Israel overnight again. The military struck the mortar launcher early Sunday but the calm held, with neither side appearing eager to resume hostilities.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not accept a cease-fire unless it included an end to all militant hostilities, including incendiary kites and balloons from Gaza that have devastated nearby Israeli farmlands and nature reserves.  “The Israeli military has delivered its most punishing blow against Hamas since the 2014 war. I hope they got the message. If not, they will get it later on,” he said at the weekly cabinet meeting.  After several balloons drifted into Israel Sunday, the military said it targeted the Hamas squad that had launched them from the northern Gaza Strip.

The explosion appeared to be an accidental blast related to militant stock piles of explosives. Hamas said it would investigate.  Israel said it unleashed Saturday’s barrage in response to weeks of violence along Gaza’s border — including a grenade attack Friday that wounded an officer — as well as sustained Hamas rocket attacks and a campaign of incendiary devices floating over the border.  Hamas responded with more than 200 projectiles toward Israel communities, evoking memories of the three wars the sides have waged over the past decade. Israel said its Iron Dome defense system shot down more than 20 projectiles.  Israel also destroyed several Hamas attack tunnels, as well as factories involved in the production of the incendiary kites and balloons, and a Hamas battalion headquarters in northern Gaza.  “We have no intention of tolerating rockets, kites, drones or anything,” said Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman. “I hope that Hamas will draw conclusions and if not, they will have to pay a heavy price.”  A Palestinian man looks at a building that was destroyed by Israeli air strikes in Gaza City July 15, 2018. Photo by Suhaib Salem/Reuters  Two teenagers were killed and several others were wounded when Israel struck an unfinished five-story building near a Hamas security compound and a public park in Gaza City, reducing the structure to rubble. The military said Hamas was using it as a training facility and had dug a tunnel underneath as part of its underground network.  The rare strike in the heart of Gaza City blew out windows at a nearby mosque, an art gallery, government offices, a tech start-up company and dozens of houses, leaving light fixtures and wiring dangling. The Al-Azhar university said its classrooms and the dentistry college lab were also damaged.  Speaking to thousands attending the two teenagers’ funeral, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh vowed to continue Gaza protests and to take revenge for the teens. He also met with the U.N. Mideast envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, who urged both sides to maintain calm  “Yesterday we were on the brink of war, and it has taken the concerted efforts of everyone to make sure that we step back from confrontation,” Mladenov said in Gaza. “Everybody needs to take a step back.”  The strike that killed the teenagers unleashed a Hamas’ launch toward the Israeli border town of Sderot, where a rocket hit the Buchris family home.  “We were sitting in the living room and all of a sudden, the aquarium exploded and there was smoke everywhere and glass flew everywhere,” said Aharon Buchris, who was wounded along with his wife and two teenage daughters, as he awaited surgery in hospital.  Israel has been warning Hamas that while it has no interest in exacerbating hostilities, it will not tolerate Gaza militants’ continued efforts to breach the border and its campaign of incendiary attacks on Israeli border communities.  Hamas-led border protests are aimed in part at drawing attention to the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed after Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007. Over 130 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since protests began on March 30.  With Israel focused on efforts to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military foothold in neighboring Syria, it has been wary of escalating violence in Gaza. Netanyahu has also come under pressure from southern Israeli communities under rocket fire from Gaza.  Hamas, meanwhile, has been trying to break out of its isolation and spotlight the hardships of the impoverished strip without invoking the full wrath of Israel.

The mass marches were led by Gaza’s ruling Hamas group and touted as the launch of a six-week-long protest campaign. Palestinian health officials said 15 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire and more than 750 hit by live rounds, making it the bloodiest day in Gaza since the 2014 cross-border war between Israel and Hamas.  In Friday’s confrontations, large crowds gathered near the border fence, with smaller groups of protesters rushing forward, throwing stones and burning tires.  Israeli troops responded with live fire and rubber-coated steel pellets, while drones dropped tear gas from above. The army released video showing soldiers with rifles perched on high earthen embankments overlooking the scene.  Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, the chief army spokesman, denied allegations of excessive use of force, saying those killed by Israeli troops were men between the ages of 18 and 30 who were involved in violence and belonged to militant factions.  He alleged Gaza health officials exaggerated the number of those wounded, and that several dozen at most were injured by live fire while the rest were merely shaken up by tear gas and other riot dispersal means.

He said 40 surgeries were performed Friday and that 50 were planned Saturday. “These are all from live bullets that broke limbs or caused deep, open wounds with damage to nerves and veins,” he said.  Among those recovering from surgery was 16-year-old Marwan Yassin who had thrown stones with a slingshot at the fence Friday and was shot in both legs. One of his legs was wrapped in bandages and the other had a cast and metal fixtures.   His mother said at his bedside that she would forbid him from participating in future protests.  On Saturday, a few hundred people gathered at five tent encampments set up several hundred meters from the border fence. The tents serve as the launch points for marches.  Protest organizers have said mass marches would continue until May 15, the 70th anniversary of Israel’s creation. Palestinians mark that date as their “nakba,” or catastrophe, when hundreds of thousands were uprooted during the 1948 war over Israel’s creation. The vast majority of Gaza’s 2 million people are descendants of Palestinians who fled or were driven from homes in what is now Israel.  Manelis reiterated Saturday that Israel “will not allow a massive breach of the fence into Israeli territory.”  He said that Hamas and other Gaza militant groups are using protests as a cover for staging attacks. If violence continues, “we will not be able to continue limiting our activity to the fence area and will act against these terror organizations in other places too,” he said.  The border protests were seen as a new attempt by Hamas to break the border blockade, imposed by Israel and Egypt after the Islamic militant group seized Gaza from forces loyal to its rival, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, in 2007. The continued closure has made it increasingly difficult for Hamas to govern.  The large turnout of marchers in the dangerous border zone also seemed to signal desperation among Gaza residents. Life in the coastal strip has deteriorated further in recent months, with rising unemployment, grinding poverty and daily blackouts that last for hours.  The protest campaign is also meant to spotlight Palestinian demands for a “right of return” to what is now Israel.  The prospect of more protests and Palestinian casualties in coming weeks could also place Israel on the defensive.  At the United Nations, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for an independent investigation, while Security Council members urged restraint on both sides. The council didn’t decide on any action or joint message after an emergency meeting Friday evening.  Abbas, the West Bank-based leader, renewed a call for international protection of Palestinians.  In the West Bank, shopkeepers observed a commercial strike called by political activists Saturday to protest Israel’s response to the Gaza marches.  ___  Heller reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

3152,NOT_STRIKE,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Western forces are trying to use Christianity to influence  China’s society and even “subvert” the government, a senior official said, warning that Chinese Christians needed to follow a Chinese model of the religion. FILE PHOTO: A believer reads the bible during mass at St. Joseph's Church, a government-sanctioned Catholic church, in Beijing, China, October 1, 2018.   REUTERS/Thomas Peter China’s constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party. The government has cracked down on underground churches, both Protestant and Catholic, even as it seeks to improve relations with the Vatican. In a speech on Monday, Xu Xiaohong head of the National Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement of the Protestant Churches in China, said there were many problems with Christianity in the country, including “infiltration” from abroad and “private meeting places”. “It must be recognised that our movement’s surname is ‘China’ and not ‘Western’,” Xu said, according to remarks reported on Tuesday by the United Front Work Department, which is in charge of co-opting non-communists, ethnic minorities and religious groups. “Anti-China forces in the West are trying to continue to influence China’s social stability and even subvert our country’s political power through Christianity, and it is doomed to fail,” he said, speaking to parliament’s largely ceremonial advisory body. “For individual black sheep who, under the banner of Christianity, participate in subverting national security, we firmly support the country to bring them to justice.” Only by eliminating the “stigma of foreign religion” in China’s Christianity can its believers benefit society, he added. “Only by continually drawing on the fine traditions of Chinese culture, can China’s Christianity be rooted in the fertile soil of Chinese culture and become a religion recognised by the Chinese themselves,” Xu added. “Only by continuously carrying forward and practicing the core values ​​of socialism can our Christianity truly be suited to socialist society.” China has been following a policy it calls the “Sinicisation” of religion, trying to root out foreign influences and enforce obedience to the Communist Party. Restrictions on religion have attracted particular concern in the United States. Last week, during a visit to Hong Kong, the U.S. ambassador for religious freedom called on Beijing to end religious persecution. What China calls a de-radicalisation programme in its restive far western region of Xinjiang has also caused widespread opprobrium in Western capitals and amongst rights groups, who say authorities have been placing Muslims there in internment camps. The government says they are vocational training centres where the Uighur people who call Xinjiang home and other Muslim peoples are sent to learn about the law and the Mandarin language, and has defended the practice. Yang Jie, an imam from Xinjiang, told the same advisory body on Monday that some adherents had poor “religious and civic awareness”, which made them vulnerable to “the temptation and incitement of religious extremist forces”. They mistakenly believed that their religion came before their citizenship, and that certain illegal acts were a “firm expression of faith”, Yang said. “This wrong view and behaviour has seriously affected social stability, ethnic unity and religious harmony, and has vilified the social image of the Muslim community and must be resolutely stopped.” Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Robert Birsel Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",False,2019-03-12 00:00:00+00:00,2019-03-23 01:22:29.395652+00:00,3153,True,2,China official says West using Christianity to 'subvert' power,https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-china-parliament-religion/china-official-says-west-using-christianity-to-subvert-power-idUKKBN1QT03A

Polizia Di Stato/Handout via REUTERS ROME (Reuters) - Italian police discovered 270 kg (600 lb) of heroin hidden in a container that arrived aboard a ship from Iran, the biggest such haul for at least 20 years in Italy, police said on Thursday. The freighter had set sail from the Iranian Gulf port of Bandar Abbas and stopped off in Hamburg, Germany and Valencia, Spain before reaching the Italian port of Genoa on Oct. 17, where police discovered the heroin stashed away in a consignment of Bentonite clay. A police spokesman said investigators were not sure when or where the drugs were brought onto the ship. Police allowed a small portion of the illicit cargo to continue its planned journey by truck to the Netherlands. They tracked the vehicle as it crossed Switzerland, France and Belgium before reaching the Dutch town of Roosendal. When the vehicle pulled into a warehouse on Nov. 2, Italian and Dutch police raided the premises and arrested two men of Turkish origin. The truck driver apparently did not know heroin was in his rig, police said. “The investigation continues in order to trace the entire network that manages the drug trade, which shows, once again, that the port of Genoa is an important crossroads for drug shipments destined for the rest of Europe,” a statement said.

35,NOT_STRIKE," CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — The leafy New Zealand city where a self-proclaimed racist fatally shot 50 people at mosques during Friday prayers is known for its picturesque meandering river and English heritage. For decades, Christchurch has also been the center of the country’s small but persistent white supremacist movement.  An expert on such fringe groups says it’s probably more than coincidence that the accused mosque shooter, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, settled in the region, known for a whiter demographic than the country’s north, after frequently traveling abroad in 2016-2018 in what appears to have been an extreme-right pilgrimage.  He went mostly to areas of Europe with a long history of sectarian dispute, including clashes between Renaissance Europe and the Ottoman Empire and the breakup of Yugoslavia following its ethnic and religious conflicts.  The attack has upended New Zealand’s image as one of the world’s safest and most tolerant countries. It also has highlighted apparent failings by security and intelligence services to view white supremacists as a real threat or to take seriously warnings from Muslim groups of a rise in Islamophobic and xenophobic incidents in recent years.  READ MORE: Donate, organize or show up: How to help after the New Zealand massacre  Tarrant planned his attack on two mosques meticulously and had resolved two years earlier to kill Muslims, according to a manifesto he published moments before the massacre. He actively planned the Christchurch shootings for the past three months, he said in the manifesto posted online and emailed to the office of New Zealand’s prime minister minutes before driving to his first target, the golden-domed Al Noor mosque.  Police say they are certain Tarrant was the only gunman but may have had support and are investigating that possibility. He had five guns, two of which were converted into semi-automatic weapons. It’s likely that at least some were legally purchased online from a Christchurch gun store.  Possible links between the shooter and white supremacists in New Zealand’s south have been alleged by recreational gun user and hunting guide Pete Breidahl.  In a video posted on Facebook on Saturday, he said he complained in late 2017 to an arms officer — a local police officer who monitors people’s gun licenses — about the disturbing behavior of members of a rifle club in the southern city of Dunedin that Tarrant reportedly joined.  In the video and comments posted online, Breidahl said the club members had Confederate flags, wore camouflage clothing with rank insignia, vilified Muslims and had homicidal fantasies. He claimed to have met Tarrant, calling him “not right.” Police said they have no record of a complaint but are looking into Breidahl’s claims further.  Academic Paul Spoonley, who has extensively researched white supremacist groups in New Zealand, said they have been relatively quiet in Christchurch since a 2011 earthquake that forced whole neighborhoods to move and altered the city’s demographics with an influx of migrant workers for reconstruction.  “They’ve been quieter recently but they haven’t gone away. They are still here,” he said, citing a 2016 incident in which pigs’ heads were left at the Al Noor mosque, where 42 people died in Friday’s massacre.  A view of the dome of Al Noor mosque, where the shooting took place, in Christchurch, New Zealand. Photo by Edgar Su/Reuters  A business owner in Christchurch has also attracted media attention since the massacre because his company’s vans were emblazoned with neo-Nazi references including the “black sun” symbol that Tarrant’s guns were covered with. The same images, which are used as the company’s branding, appear on its website.  When AP visited the registered business address, located in one of Christchurch’s poorer neighborhoods, three of its vans were parked opposite, their “black sun” imagery removed but still identifiable by a company website address on them. A visibly hostile man standing beside the vans, who did not appear to be the business owner, did not want to answer questions.  Police on Tuesday said they had arrested a 44-year-old man in Christchurch for distributing objectionable material and he would appear in court the next day.  According to Spoonley, the level of hate crimes in New Zealand is low compared with other countries as is the number of white supremacists, but it’s “always a challenge to get people to accept that they exist.”  “There’s a reluctance to see equivalence between the risks presented by right-wing extremist groups and radical Islamic and leftist groups,” he said.  Neighboring Australia’s white supremacist scene is more virulent, in part reflecting the history of its “White Australia” immigration policy which existed in various forms from soon after Federation in 1901 to as late as 1973. In modern times, the rise of a succession of prominent right-wing politicians — starting with Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in the mid-1990s — also legitimized such views.  Spoonley estimates there are 200-250 hardcore white supremacists in New Zealand and about 300-400 people on the edges.  “I would be very surprised if Tarrant didn’t make some sort of contact,” he said.  The groups, which emerged in the late 1960s, have evolved over time, coalescing for years around fear of New Zealand moving too far from its British roots, anti-Semitism and opposition to Maori sovereignty and Asian immigrants, and then shifting to Islamophobia following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S.  Spoonley, who researched extreme-right groups in the U.K. in the 1970s, said when he returned to New Zealand in the 1980s he was told by authorities there were no similar organizations.  But he quickly found more than 70 extreme-right groups, many of them in Christchurch. He attributes three murders in New Zealand since 1989 to white supremacists, including two that were ideologically motivated — a South Korean tourist in 2003 and a homeless gay man in 1999.  As Tarrant plotted more recently, Muslim groups in New Zealand were growing increasingly concerned by a rise in abuse against the community but say they were ignored.  “There has been an increasing trend which has been brought to the attention of the authorities several times in the last three to four years, including police,” said Anwar Ghani, a spokesman for a federation of Islamic organizations. “It was treated not so seriously.”  Verbal abuse, hate emails, hate phone calls and assaults that seem to have an Islamophobic and racist motivation, or a combination of the two, are among the hate crimes experienced by Muslims in New Zealand, he said.  The country does not have an official hate crimes database, making it difficult to measure the trend, but some incidents have been widely reported, causing outrage but sparking no real official measures.  Ghani said there are dotted lines between Friday’s massacre, hostility to Muslims among a segment of the New Zealand population and the global rise of extreme right-wing movements.  “If the issue is not addressed in a proper manner then the problem will continue to increase,” he said. “They are getting bolder and bolder.”  Paul Buchanan, a former policy analyst and intelligence consultant for U.S. government security agencies, said the failure of intelligence agencies to detect Tarrant reflects politically based decisions to concentrate resources on monitoring the small number of Islamic extremists in New Zealand.  “My interpretation is that in the past 20 years and since 9/11 a political decision was made to prioritize detection and prevention of homegrown jihadists,” he said.  “They decided to go whole hog, 80-85 percent of resources into detecting jihadists,” he said. “The rest was devoted to Marxists, environmentalists, animal rights activists. They went for the left.”  One such jihadi from New Zealand, along with an Australian, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in November 2013 while fighting for al-Qaida.  There was no political advantage in targeting alienated young white men seen by the wider population as mostly harmless “Pakeha losers,” a Maori word for white New Zealanders, Buchanan said.  Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the government will convene an inquiry into the intelligence and security services, seeking to understand why Tarrant was able to escape detection.  Tarrant, according to Buchanan, may have been part of a small cell.  “There could be tacit enablers,” he said.  “He was planning for two years,” Buchanan said. “To be able to do that in utter secrecy suggests someone had to have an inkling that the guy was going to do something and said nothing about it.”  READ MORE: New Zealand citizens open to gun reform after massacre ",False,2019-03-19 13:28:00+00:00,2019-03-22 22:21:41.890265+00:00,36,True,1,Christchurch harbored white supremacists before massacre,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/christchurch-harbored-white-supremacists-before-massacre

Security has forced the Nobel prize winner, whose arrival in the country dominated headlines and social media, to keep her itinerary tightly under wraps.  Malala said there was “definitely a difference between the Pakistan of today and in 2012"", when she was airlifted to a British hospital after being shot in the head by Taliban gunmen angered over her stance as an advocate for girls' education.  “Things are becoming better, people are uniting and a campaign for better Pakistan is ongoing, people are active which is very good.”  The Oxford student, who has said that she wants to run for prime minister one day, added: “It is my plan to return to Pakistan after completing my education because it is my country and I have equal rights on it like any other Pakistani.”  Her comments came after she broke down in tears as she delivered an emotional televised speech a day earlier saying it was a “dream” to be back in the country after so many years.  Also read: Twitter welcomes Malala, shuts down haters as she makes surprise visit to Pakistan  Malala is widely respected internationally as a global icon for girls' education, but opinion is divided in Pakistan, where some conservatives view her as a Western agent on a mission to shame her country.  “Pakistan has not done well by its heroes,” an editorial in Dawn on Malala's homecoming said on Friday, noting that the country's other Nobel laureate ─ physicist Abdus Salaam ─ had been widely shunned for being a member of the persecuted Ahmadi minority.  With intense criticism among the many messages of welcome, even the people she is meeting have been kept in the dark about her presence.  Women's rights activist Nighat Dad said that she and a group of other women from across Pakistan who were gathered on Thursday were not told they would be seeing Malala until the last moment.  The organiser, Oscar-winning director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, only told them “It'll be the highlight of your year,” Dad said ─ adding that she had been right.  Changing lives  Malala became a global symbol for human rights after a gunman boarded her school van on October 9, 2012, asked “Who is Malala?” and shot her.  The Pakistani Taliban accused her of “anti-Islamic” activities and of “smearing” the militant group in statements released after the attack.  She was treated for her injuries in the British city of Birmingham, where she also completed her schooling.  The youngest-ever winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, she has continued to be a vocal advocate for girls' education while studying at Oxford University.  Swat, Malala's former home in Pakistan's rugged northwest, was overrun by the Taliban in 2007, where they imposed a brutal regime including banning girls from school.  They were pushed out in a military operation in 2009, but security has remained fragile, as the attack on Malala three years later demonstrated.  However, in recent weeks, authorities have lifted prohibitions against tourists visiting the mountainous region, famed for its beauty, as security improves.  Residents say Malala's story has changed the lives of other girls in the area.  “Parents are sending their girls to school so Malala has been successful in her aim,” Swat resident Shahista Hakeem told AFP .  Many of those who live in the area were happy to hear of Malala's return to Pakistan, Hakeem said, adding: “We want that she should come to Swat also. “ ",False,2018-03-30 00:00:00+00:00,2019-03-24 17:49:15.139840+00:00,36687,True,3,Malala plans to return to Pakistan after completing education,https://www.dawn.com/news/1398521/malala-plans-to-return-to-pakistan-after-completing-education

The TTP spokesman, Shahidullah Shahid quoted by AFP said, “The committee members will hold talks with their interlocutors in the government’s team on our behalf and put forth our point of view.” Mr. Khan strongly backs negotiations with the Taliban group in Pakistan and has criticized the U.S. drone strikes targeting militants in the area. Thousands of civilians, police officers and government officials have been killed in the Taliban-led insurgency in Pakistan, which aims to topple the Pakistani government and enforce a stringent form of Islamic law.

3631,NOT_STRIKE,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday denied interfering in Canada’s judicial system as he sought to defuse a month-long crisis threatening his political future, but offered no apology, asserting only that lessons had been learned. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks at a news conference in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Patrick Doyle The crisis has prompted the resignations of former Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Treasury Board president, Jane Philpott, and Trudeau’s closest political aide, Gerald Butts. It also raised questions about Trudeau’s handling of the affair and polls show his Liberals could lose an election this October. WHAT ARE THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST TRUDEAU Trudeau has been dogged by allegations that he and his officials improperly leaned on Wilson-Raybould to help construction firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a criminal trial. Wilson-Raybould told the House of Commons justice committee last week that officials imposed “consistent and sustained pressure” on her from September to December last year to ensure SNC-Lavalin pay a large fine rather than go to trial. WHAT IS SNC-LAVALIN’S INVOLVEMENT? Montreal-based construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was charged in 2015 by the Public Prosecution Service of Canada with bribing Libyan officials to influence the awarding of contracts between 2001 and 2011. The company had tried unsuccessfully to avoid trial, arguing instead for a negotiated settlement since it had cleaned shop by changing executives and overhauling its ethics and compliance systems in recent years. The preliminary hearings in the case are ongoing. The company has historically had close ties to the Liberals. In 2016, SNC-Lavalin admitted that some former executives had illegally arranged donations of more than C$80,000 (£45,465) to the Liberals from 2004 to 2011. WHY IS SNC-LAVALIN CRITICAL TO TRUDEAU AND LIBERALS? SNC-Lavalin has about 9,000 employees in Canada, including about 3,400 in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec, which also includes Trudeau’s parliamentary constituency. The Liberals say they need to pick up enough seats in Quebec in the October election to stand a chance of retaining a majority government. Officials, citing conversations they said they had with the company, say they feared SNC-Lavalin would cut jobs or move its headquarters out of Quebec if found guilty. The company faces being barred from bidding on Canadian federal procurement contracts for 10 years, if found guilty. “We will not comment on this matter,” SNC-Lavalin spokesman Nicolas Ryan said on Thursday when asked if the company had warned Trudeau of possible job losses in case of a guilty verdict. WHY DOES CRISIS THREATEN TRUDEAU’S POLITICAL FUTURE? Critics accuse Trudeau of double standards and breaking the promises he made to do politics differently. Trudeau, 47, came to power in November 2015 promising more accountability and a greater number of women in the Cabinet. He now finds himself accused of trying to help arrange an old-style backroom deal with a major company as his officials leaned on a high-profile woman Cabinet minister. The departure of Philpott, another well-regarded minister and a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, has dented Trudeau’s credibility. No one inside the ruling Liberals has mounted an open challenge to Trudeau, since to do so would take time and open up splits inside the party. The heads of political parties in Canada are elected by party members at formal conventions and cannot be ousted after a snap vote by parliamentarians, as is the case in the UK and Australia. Opinion polls show the controversy is costing the Liberals. A weekly tracking poll released by Nanos Research on Tuesday put the Conservatives at 35 percent public support, with the Liberals at 34 percent. A Jan. 8 poll by the same firm had the Liberals at 39 percent and the Conservatives at 33 percent. Each poll was based on a random phone survey of 1,000 Canadians. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Political analysts say Trudeau is safe for now, since he has made clear he wants to stay on and there are no challengers inside the party. The federal Parliament is not sitting next week, depriving the opposition of the chance to grill Trudeau, and the week after will see the release of the federal budget. The two main opposition parties - the right-of-center Conservatives and the left-leaning New Democrats are demanding a public inquiry into the affair. But the Liberals oppose the idea, since probes take months to complete and are likely to trigger negative headlines. Wilson-Raybould said she did not consider officials had broken any laws, so a probe by police is unlikely. Canada’s independent ethics commissioner is looking into the allegations, but past experience shows such investigations can take months to wrap up and there is no guarantee the results would be released before the vote in October.

1818,NOT_STRIKE," KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban tried to overrun a provincial capital in Afghanistan early on Friday, hiding inside homes before slipping into city streets in the night to attack security forces and killing at least 14 policemen before being pushed back, officials said.  The overnight attack in the southeastern city of Ghazni, the capital of a province with the same name, also wounded at least 20 members of the security forces, said Baz Mohammad Hemat, the administrator of the Ghazni city hospital.  The city was in lockdown and fighting continued throughout the day Friday, with sporadic bursts of gunfire from Taliban fighters who had hunkered down in elevated positions inside Ghazni from which they were shooting, some residents said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear for their safety.  An Afghan military helicopter crash landed in the city during the daytime fighting, and four Afghan soldiers on board were injured, one critically, said Mohammad Radmanish, spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.      The brazen assaults by the Taliban, who have been gaining more ground in their annual spring offensive and who have shrugged off the government’s latest offers of a cease-fire and negotiations, underscore the difficulties Afghan forces face in battling the relentless insurgency on their own in efforts to end the nearly 17-year war.   The Taliban claimed they had downed the “enemy” helicopter in Ghazni but Radmanish said it was not immediately clear if the helicopter had been hit or crash landed due to other reasons.  Elsewhere in Afghanistan, a Taliban attack Thursday night in western Herat province left six policemen dead in the district of Obe, said the governor’s spokesman there, Gelani Farhad.  The brazen assaults by the Taliban, who have been gaining more ground in their annual spring offensive and who have shrugged off the government’s latest offers of a cease-fire and negotiations, underscore the difficulties Afghan forces face in battling the relentless insurgency on their own in efforts to end the nearly 17-year war.  The Ghazni attack began around 2 a.m. with intense gunbattles raging and fires burning in several shops in the city’s residential areas, provincial police chief Farid Ahmad Mashal told The Associated Press.  After repulsing the first assault, police conducted house-to-house searches for remaining Taliban fighters. Also, an investigation was underway to determine how the insurgents managed to infiltrate so deep into the city, barely 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of the Afghan capital of Kabul.  Hemat, the hospital administrator, said two wounded civilians were brought to the hospital. He was worried more wounded could be out there as the city was shut down and ambulances were not being sent out.  Mashal said there were more than 100 other casualties but he could not give a breakdown of the dead and wounded. Most of the casualties were Taliban, he said.  Several bodies of dead Taliban fighters remained on the streets of Ghazni, the police chief said. In one location, bodies of 39 Taliban fighters were recovered from under a bridge on the southern edge of the city.  Airstrikes called in to quash the offensive also killed dozens of Taliban, Mashal said.      The insurgents have stepped up attacks across the country since NATO and the United States formally ended their combat mission in 2014, and have seized control of several districts.   Lt. Col. Martin O’Donnell, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said American forces and U.S. attack helicopters had assisted Afghan troops in pushing back the Taliban during the night’s multiple attacks in Ghazni.  “U.S. forces responded with close-air support and conducted one drone strike,” O’Donnell said.  By midday Friday, O’Donnell said fighting continued inside Ghazni, prompting the U.S. forces to return American attack helicopters and fighter jets to the area after they were initially pulled back.  “It is a show of presence,” he said.  Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed that parts of Ghazni had been seized and that Taliban fighters had killed scores of people. He also told the AP over the phone that Taliban anti-aircraft fire downed the Afghan army helicopter.  Mujahid did not comment on the Herat attack that killed six policemen at a district checkpoint.  After dawn Friday, Ghazni’s residents were staying indoors and all shops in the city remained closed. The road from Kabul to Afghanistan’s southern provinces was also closed because it runs through Ghazni.  The insurgents have stepped up attacks across the country since NATO and the United States formally ended their combat mission in 2014, and have seized control of several districts. U.S. and NATO forces remain in Afghanistan mainly in a supporting and training role.  Separately from the Taliban, an Islamic State affiliate has also carried out dozens of deadly attacks in recent years, mainly targeting security forces and minority Shiites.  ___  Associated Press writers Kathy Gannon in Islamabad and Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report.

2875,NOT_STRIKE," BEIRUT — Russia and the Syrian military blamed Israel for a pre-dawn missile attack Monday on a major air base in central Syria that reportedly killed 14 people, including Iranians, while international condemnation grew over a suspected poison gas attack over the weekend that was blamed on the Syrian government.  Opposition activists said 40 people died in the chemical attack , blaming Syrian government forces. The U.N. Security Council planned to hold an emergency meeting Monday to discuss the chemical attack.  Russia’s Defense Ministry said two Israeli aircraft targeted the T4 air base in Homs province, firing eight missiles. It said Syria shot down five of them while the other three landed in the western part of the base. Syrian state TV quoted an unnamed military official as saying that Israeli F-15 warplanes fired several missiles at T4. It gave no further details.  Israel’s foreign ministry had no comment when asked about reports of the airstrikes, which did not appear to be related to Saturday night’s alleged chemical weapons attack.   Since 2012, Israel has struck inside Syria more than 100 times, mostly targeting suspected weapons’ convoys destined for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, which has been fighting alongside Syrian government forces.  Most recently, Israel hit the same T4 base in February, after it said an Iranian drone that had violated Israeli airspace took off from the base. The base, which was used as a launching pad for counter offensive attacks against Islamic State militants who were at one point stationed close by, is near the Shayrat air base, which was targeted by U.S. missiles last year in response to a chemical weapons attack.  Monday’s missile attack came hours after President Donald Trump warned there would be a “big price to pay” after Saturday’s suspected poison gas attack on the last remaining foothold for Syrian rebels in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. At least 40 people were killed in that assault, including families found in their homes and shelters, opposition activists and local rescuers said.  Syria’s state news agency SANA initially said the attack on the T4 air base was likely “an American aggression,” but Pentagon spokesman Christopher Sherwood quickly denied the United States was behind the strike and the agency then dropped the accusation, blaming Israel instead.  SANA said the missile attack resulted in a number of casualties but provided no specific figures.  The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war through a network of activists on the ground, said 14 died, including Iranians and also three Syrian officers.  Rami Abdurrahman, the Observatory’s chief, said the assault targeted a mobile air defense unit and some buildings inside the air base. He added that it also hit posts outside the base used by the Iranians and Iran-backed fighters.  Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, told reporters on Monday that that Israel had not spoken to the president ahead of the airstrike even though there may have been Russian military advisers at the base, which he described as “a cause for concern for us.”  The U.S. launched several dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base last year, after a chemical attack in the northern Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun killed dozens of people.  Saturday’s suspected poison gas attack on the besieged town of Douma came almost exactly a year after the U.S. missile attack prompted by the Khan Sheikhoun deaths.  A girl looks on following alleged chemical weapons attack, in what is said to be Douma, Syria, in this still image from video obtained by Reuters on April 8, 2018. Photo by White Helmets/Reuters TV via Reuters  In response to the reports, Trump on Sunday blamed Syrian government forces for what he called a “mindless CHEMICAL attack.” In a series of tweets, Trump held Russia and Iran, Syrian President Bashar Assad’s chief sponsors, responsible.  Trump was to meet with his senior military leadership on Monday, the same day his new national security adviser, John Bolton, assumes his post. Bolton has previously advocated significant airstrikes against Syria. The European Union also laid the blame squarely on Assad’s government.  The Syrian government denied the chemical weapons allegations, calling them fabrications. The Russian military said its officers visited the hospital in Douma and talked to the staff, and said they did not confirm reports of the assault.  First responders entering apartments in Douma late Saturday said they found bodies collapsed on floors, some foaming at the mouth. The opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense rescue organization said the victims appeared to have suffocated.  The organization, also known as the White Helmets, and the Syrian American Medical Society, a medical relief organization, did not identify the substance used but said survivors treated at clinics smelled strongly of chlorine.  Those reports could not be independently verified because of a government blockade around the town.  A man is washed following an alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma, Syria in this still image from video obtained by Reuters on April 8. Photo by White Helmets/Reuters TV  Hours after the attack, the Army of Islam rebel group agreed to surrender the town and evacuate their fighters to rebel-held northern Syria, Syrian state media reported. The group also agreed to give up its prisoners, a key government demand.  More than 100 buses entered the town on Sunday night to take the fighters and their families to Jarablus, a town under the shared control of rebels and Turkey, said Syrian state-affiliated al-Ikhbariya TV.  Syrian state TV said two buses left early Monday and that 11 more buses were getting ready to move.  Syrian state media said dozens of civilians who had been held for years by the rebels were set free. The SANA news agency said the people were freed around midnight on Sunday, adding that they had been held by the Army of Islam group since 2013.  The evacuations follow a pattern of departures around the capital, Damascus, and other major Syrian cities as the government reasserts its control after seven years of war.  In his tweets Sunday, Trump called Assad an “animal” and delivered a rare personal criticism of Putin for supporting him. Trump has declared his intent to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria in the coming months, despite resistance from many of his advisers.  Syrian rescuers from the White Helmets documented 42 fatalities in Saturday’s reported chemical attack but were impeded from searching further by strong odors that caused breathing difficulties, said Siraj Mahmoud, a spokesman for the group.  More than 500 people, mostly women and children, were brought to medical centers complaining of difficulties breathing, foaming at the mouth and burning sensations in the eyes. Some had bluish skin, a sign of oxygen deprivation, according to a statement, symptoms consistent with chemical exposure.  The Observatory gave a higher death toll, saying at least 80 people were killed in Douma, including around 40 who died from suffocation. But it said the suffocations were the result of shelters collapsing on people inside them.  In denying the chemical weapons allegations, a government statement said “the army, which is advancing rapidly and with determination, does not need to use any kind of chemical agents.”  Russia denied any involvement in the attack. Maj. Gen. Yuri Yevtushenko was quoted by Russian news agencies Sunday as saying Russia was prepared to send specialists to Douma to “confirm the fabricated nature” of the reports.  In recent weeks, government forces have recaptured villages and towns in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of the capital. Douma was the only town left holding out.  A 2013 chemical attack in eastern Ghouta that killed hundreds of people was widely blamed on government forces. The U.S. threatened military action but later backed down.  Syria denies ever using chemical weapons during the war and says it eliminated its chemical arsenal under a 2013 agreement brokered by the U.S. and Russia.

5815,NOT_STRIKE," NEW YORK — The United States and Russia are taking their differences over the conflict in Syria to new heights, after trading ferocious allegations of duplicity and malfeasance at the United Nations Security Council.  After a fractious meeting of the council on Wednesday, Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov were set to duel again at a gathering of foreign ministers from the roughly 20 nations that have interests in Syria. Thursday’s meeting of the International Syria Support Group comes after the two blamed each other for spoiling the country’s cease-fire that they had agreed to only two weeks before.  Amid deep pessimism over whether the truce could be resurrected, the group was to consider a U.S. call for all warplanes to halt flights over aid routes following an attack on a humanitarian convoy near the besieged city of Aleppo and a Russian suggestion for a three-day pause in fighting to get the so-called “cessation of hostilities” back on track. However, diplomats said prospects for the success of either idea were unclear.  The meeting also comes after Syrian President Bashar Assad blamed the U.S. for the collapse of the cease-fire in an interview with The Associated Press in Damascus. Assad said the U.S. lacked “the will” to join forces with Russia in fighting extremists and rejected Washington’s claim that airstrikes last week on Syrian troops were accidental.  The diametrically opposed views of Washington and Moscow were underscored at the Security Council meeting that had originally been called to enshrine the Sept. 9 truce. Instead, members rued the possibility of a darker phase in the conflict amid increased attacks on humanitarian workers. And, in unusually blunt language, they illustrated why they’ve been unable for more than five years to stop Syria’s civil war.      “Everybody sits there and says we want a united Syria, secular, respecting the rights of all people, in which the people of Syria can choose their leadership. But we are proving woefully inadequate in our ability to be able to get to the table and have that conversation and make it happen.” — Secretary of State John Kerry   “Supposedly we all want the same goal. I’ve heard that again and again,” a visibly angry Kerry told the council. “Everybody sits there and says we want a united Syria, secular, respecting the rights of all people, in which the people of Syria can choose their leadership. But we are proving woefully inadequate in our ability to be able to get to the table and have that conversation and make it happen.”  While the U.S. and Russia have previously butted heads over several proposed resolutions critical of the Syrian government, Wednesday’s agenda didn’t even include a suggested course of action. Instead, the two-hour discussion served as a warm-up act for Thursday’s meeting.  Kerry blamed Russia, lambasting what he portrayed as a cynical response to an airstrike on a humanitarian aid convoy this week that killed 20 civilians and raised “profound doubt” about Russia’s and Syria’s willingness to abide by the cease-fire. The U.S. believes that a Russian-piloted aircraft carried out the strike, said a senior American official, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity.  Russia has denied U.S. claims that it was responsible, but Kerry focused on its shifting explanation of what might have happened.  First, Kerry said, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s press secretary described the attack as a “necessary response” to an alleged offensive by al-Qaida-linked militants elsewhere in the country. Then, a Russian ambassador said forces were targeting another area.  Russia’s Defense Ministry followed by saying the aid convoy was accompanied by militants in a pickup truck with a mortar, Kerry said, adding that no such evidence exists. Then, the ministry denied any Russian or Syrian involvement as its spokesman suggested, in Kerry’s words, that “the food and the medicine just spontaneously combusted.”  “This is not a joke,” Kerry exclaimed, urging all to stop the “word games that duck responsibility or avoid the choices … with respect to war and peace, life and death.” His pleas crossed paths with another statement by Russia’s government, this time suggesting a U.S. coalition Predator drone was operating nearby when the convoy attack occurred. The Pentagon said no drone was in the area at the time.  It was one of Kerry’s most bitter exchanges with Moscow as secretary of state, laced with invective and outrage.  But he also offered one concrete suggestion to revive diplomatic hopes: to ground all aircraft in key areas, focused on protecting aid routes in northern Syria.  Kerry spoke immediately after Lavrov, whose comments underscored a breakdown in trust since the pair sealed the cease-fire agreement and potential U.S.-Russian military partnership against the Islamic State and al-Qaida 12 days ago. Much of the international community hailed that outcome, only to watch it unravel amid an upsurge in violence that included an accidental U.S. strike that killed more than 60 Syrian soldiers.  Lavrov said the U.S. bore the biggest responsibility for peace by separating opposition forces from terrorists. He called for the U.N. to expand its terrorism list to include groups at the fringes of a U.S.-backed rebel umbrella group and called Washington’s errant strike an “outrageous violation.”  The Russian also cited a series of truce violations by U.S.-backed rebel groups near the northern city of Aleppo. And in a not-so-subtle jab at Washington, he called Syria’s conflict, as well as those in Iraq and Libya, the “direct consequence” of foreign military interventions and “political engineering.” ",False,2016-09-22 14:53:00+00:00,2019-03-23 02:58:23.240901+00:00,5816,True,1,"US, Russia attack each other over Syria conflict during UN",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/us-russia-attack-syria-conflict-un

3054,NOT_STRIKE," TEL AVIV, Israel — The Israeli military confirmed on Wednesday it carried out the 2007 airstrike in Syria that destroyed what was believed to be a nuclear reactor, lifting the veil of secrecy over one of its most daring and mysterious operations in recent memory.  Although Israel was widely believed to have been behind the Sept. 6, 2007, airstrike, it has never before commented publicly on it.  In a lengthy release, the military revealed that eight F-15 fighter jets carried out the top-secret airstrikes against the facility in the Deir el-Zour region, 450 kilometers (about 300 miles) northeast of Damascus, destroying a site that had been in development for years and was scheduled to go into operation at the end of that year.  Israel’s involvement has been one of its most closely held secrets, and it was not immediately clear why Israel decided to go public now. The military would not comment on its reasoning, but the move could be related to the upcoming memoir of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who ordered the strike and has hinted about it for years. It could also be meant as a warning to archenemy Iran, which is deeply involved in Syria’s conflict.  “The motivation of our enemies has grown in recent years, but so too the might of the Israeli military,” Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Wednesday. “Everyone in the Middle East would do well to internalize this equation.”  Israel and Syria have always been bitter enemies . Throughout Syria’s seven-year civil war, Israel has carried out well over 100 airstrikes, most believed to have been aimed at suspected weapons shipments destined for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group. Both Iran and Hezbollah are allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad.  At the time of the 2007 strike, Syria accused Israel of invading its airspace, but gave no further details about the target.      Israel’s involvement has been one of its most closely held secrets, and it was not immediately clear why Israel decided to go public now.   The pre-mission briefing, made public Wednesday, stated that the operation should not be attributed to Israel so as to minimize the potential for an all-out war.  The Syria strike was reminiscent of an Israeli attack in 1981 against a reactor being built in Iraq. That strike was later credited with preventing Saddam Hussein from acquiring weapons of mass destruction that could have been used in the Gulf War a decade later.  “The message from the 2007 attack on the reactor is that Israel will not tolerate construction that can pose an existential threat,” military chief Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot said in Wednesday’s statement. “This was the message in 1981, this is the message in 2007 and this is the future message to our enemies.”  Eisenkot, who at the time commanded Israel’s northern front along the Lebanese and Syrian borders, said it marked Israel’s most comprehensive attack in Syria since the 1973 Mideast war, and that everyone involved knew it could spark a new one. He said only a handful of top commanders were aware of the plans for Operation “Outside The Box.”  The military said the F-15s took off from two bases in southern Israel at 10:30 p.m. on Sept. 5, and returned four hours later.  Wednesday’s announcement also indicated the Syrian reactor was much closer to completion than previously reported.  From Israel’s perspective, the strike was an astounding success since it not only destroyed the site, but prevented further escalation and strengthened its deterrence in the region.  A screen grab from a video of an undated material released by the Israeli military on March 21, 2018 shows a debris seen on the site after what the military describes is an Israeli air strike on a suspected Syrian nuclear reactor site near Deir al-Zor on Sept. 6, 2007. Photo by IDF/Handout via Reuters  Air force commander Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin said the current turmoil in Syria has further vindicated the strike, particularly since the reactor was in an area later captured by Islamic State militants.  “Imagine what situation we would be in today if there was a nuclear reactor in Syria,” Norkin said. “Israel’s decision to destroy the reactor is one of the most important decisions taken here in the last 70 years.”  Uzi Rabi, an expert on Iran at Tel Aviv University, said Israel’s surprising confirmation might be meant as a “warning sign” to Iran as it expands its military footprint in Syria. Israel has warned against the establishment of a permanent Iranian military presence in Syria, particularly in areas close to Israel.  Tzipi Livni, who was foreign minister at the time of the strike, told The Associated Press that in discussions after Israel discovered the reactor, “we asked ourselves whether Israel can, or is, willing to live with this.”  “The answer was ‘no’ then, the answer is ‘no’ now,” she said.  Last month, Israel shot down an Iranian drone that entered its airspace, triggering a clash in which an Israeli warplane crashed after being struck by Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Israel responded by bombing Syrian anti-aircraft batteries.  In Wednesday’s statement, the military said it began obtaining information regarding foreign experts helping Syria develop the Deir el-Zour site in late 2004. Later, it discovered that North Korea was helping Syria build a reactor to manufacture plutonium.  In his memoir, “Decision Points,” former President George W. Bush said Israel first asked the United States to bomb the site, and then carried out an attack itself when Washington declined.  The strike came about a year after Israel’s inconclusive war against Hezbollah, in which the Lebanese guerrillas battled Israel’s army to a stalemate. The poor performance raised questions about Israel’s deterrent capabilities.  “Prime Minister Olmert’s execution of the strike made up for the confidence I had lost in the Israelis during the Lebanon war,” Bush wrote, adding that the Israeli leader rejected a suggestion to go public with the operation.  “Olmert told me he wanted total secrecy. He wanted to avoid anything that might back Syria into a corner and force Assad to retaliate. This was his operation, and I felt an obligation to respect his wishes,” Bush wrote.  Olmert has skirted around the issue, and military censors, for years, repeatedly saying that according to foreign sources Israel had been involved. After Bush’s account was published in 2010, Olmert said: “I don’t want (to), and I can’t deny it.”  Olmert, who was prime minister from 2006 until 2009 and was recently released from prison after serving time for corruption, is expected to delve more deeply into the issue in his upcoming book. The disclosure looks to help rehabilitate at least part of Olmert’s tarnished image while damaging the legacy of his longtime rival, then-Defense Minister Ehud Barak, who was reportedly hesitant to strike in Syria.

A senior local security official quoted by AFP said, “The US drone fired two missiles targeting a militant compound and killing at least seven militants.” Many Pakistanis oppose U.S. drone strikes because they say the strikes kill large numbers of innocent civilians — something the U.S. denies — and end up breeding more extremism by those seeking retribution.

U.S. Africa Command, which manages U.S. military operations on the continent, said the airstrike in Somalia targeted an al-Shabab camp about 125 miles northwest of the capital, Mogadishu, killing more than 100. That is the largest number of reported deaths from a single U.S. airstrike in Somalia since the Trump administration approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaida.  Al-Shabab is blamed for last month’s truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 350 people.      It’s largest number of reported deaths from a single U.S. airstrike in Somalia since the Trump administration approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab.   A Somali intelligence official said U.S. drone aircraft fired at least eight missiles at al-Shabab bases and training camps in Bur-Eylada, a village situated between the towns of Dinsor and Burhakaba in the Bay region. The official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters on the record and discussed the matter on condition of anonymity, said senior al-Shabab commanders were among the dead.  The U.S. this month also began targeting a small but growing IS presence in northern Somalia.  Separately, Africa Command said it conducted two airstrikes near Fuqaha in central Libya against Islamic State group militants — one Nov. 17 and another two days later. It made no mention of casualties and did not identify the specific targets. It said the strikes were done in coordination with Libya’s interim government, known as the Government of National Accord.

1863,NOT_STRIKE,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of people protested in central Algiers on Friday in the biggest demonstration against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s 20-year rule since unrest began last month. Protesters crammed streets and squares in the capital after Friday prayers, many draped in Algeria’s green, white and red flag. Demonstrations also took place in Bejaia, Oran, Batna, Tizi Ouzou and other cities. “Bouteflika and his men must go as soon as possible,” said Yazid Ammari, 23, a student. Reuters journalists estimated the crowd at hundreds of thousands of people, though there was no police estimate. The number fell to thousands by late afternoon. A statement from the Algerian national police (DGSN) said it arrested people involved in vandalism, theft and destruction of public and private property. No heavy clashes were reported but the authorities said some 75 protesters were arrested and 11 policemen were slightly injured during the demonstrations. Bouteflika on Monday reversed a decision to stand for another term after weeks of demonstrations against him, but he stopped short of relinquishing office and said he would stay on until a new constitution is adopted. Algerians quickly rejected his offer and demanded that the 82-year-old president hand over power to a young generation of leaders who can create jobs and stamp out corruption. “Those who think we are tired are wrong. Our protests will not stop,” said doctor Madjid Benzida, 37, as police blocked streets leading to government offices and parliament. Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. Protesters say he is no longer fit for office. The president has been losing allies in recent days since returning from medical treatment in Switzerland. Hocine Kheldoun, a senior figure from the ruling National Liberation Front party, known by its French acronym FLN, said in an interview on Thursday night the long-ruling president was “history now.” The remarks by Kheldoun to Ennahar television were another setback for Bouteflika, who hoped to pacify Algerians by promising to take steps to change a political landscape that has been dominated for decades by a ruling elite.

Some parents brought their children to Friday’s demonstration. “I want a better future,” said Mohamed Kemime, 10, draped in a national flag. One of Algeria’s most influential clerics appealed for patience. “Let’s be optimistic, Algeria needs to overcome its crisis,” said Mohamed Abdelkader Haider from an Algiers mosque. The new prime minister, Noureddine Bedoui, said on Thursday he would form a temporary government of technocrats and others to work toward political change, and he urged the opposition to join in a dialogue. ‘GAME OVER’ A former minister who is familiar with Bouteflika’s inner circle told Reuters that the president could not survive given the pressure building against him. “Game over. Bouteflika has no choice but to quit now,” the former minister said on condition of anonymity. Algeria is a major oil and gas producer, but so far exports have not been affected by the unrest. Its biggest oil field Hassi Messaoud and its Hassi Rmel gas field have been operating normally, a source from state oil giant Sonatrach told Reuters. Many Algerians say that the president and other veterans of the 1954-62 war of independence against France have neglected them for decades. The military, which has traditionally played a behind-the-scenes power broker role, has distanced itself from Bouteflika and stayed in its barracks throughout the crisis. It is expected to retain influence under all scenarios. Algeria was relatively untouched when the 2011 “Arab Spring” uprisings swept away veteran autocrats in the Arab world. Bouteflika and his allies, effective manipulators of the opposition, managed to avoid major unrest by spending oil revenue on popular programs, such as handing out low interest loans and housing. Slideshow (10 Images) Bouteflika helped to defeat a civil war against Islamist insurgents in which tens of thousands of people were killed in the 1990s, and many Algerians long accepted heavy-handed rule as the price of stability. But the public has lost patience with deteriorating economic conditions and the FLN’s failure to make the transition to a new generation despite the president’s failing health.

5831,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — The U.S. military will have to shift surveillance aircraft from other regions and increase the number of intelligence analysts to coordinate attacks with Russia under the Syria cease-fire deal partly in order to target militants the U.S. has largely spared, senior officials say.  Senior defense and military officials told The Associated Press that they are sorting out how the U.S.-Russia military partnership will take shape and how that will change where U.S. equipment and people will be deployed. They said, however, that they will need to take assets from other parts of the world, because U.S. military leaders don’t want to erode the current U.S.-led coalition campaign against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.  More military planners and targeting experts will be needed to identify and approve airstrikes against the al-Qaida-linked Jabhat Fatah al-Sham. The U.S. has rarely bombed the group, previously known as the Nusra Front, and the targeting is trickier because the militants are often intermingled with other U.S.-backed Syrian rebels.  Making matters more complicated are U.S. military concerns about Russian targeting. Unlike the U.S., which uses precision-guided munitions, Moscow has predominantly used so-called dumb bombs in its airstrikes over Syria.  The Syria cease-fire deal struck by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is designed to bring a pause to the civil war so that the superpowers’ militaries can be jointly concentrated against the Islamic extremist groups operating within the chaos on the ground. The concerns reflect the U.S. military’s broader skepticism about partnering with Russia, which it says it distrusts.  Senior U.S. defense and military officials familiar with the planning spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to talk about the matter publicly.  Under the deal, if the cease-fire holds for seven days and humanitarian deliveries are allowed into areas besieged by the Syrian army, the U.S. and Russia would set up a so-called Joint Implementation Center to focus on the militants and share basic targeting data.  State Department spokesman Mark Toner acknowledged the skepticism.  “I don’t think that anyone in the U.S. government is necessarily taking at face value Russia’s or certainly not the Syrian regime’s commitment to this arrangement,” Toner said. “I also think some of the comments from the Department of Defense were just about speaking to the fact that there’s logistical challenges of setting up the JIC (joint center) and coordinating these airstrikes and that’s going to require additional effort and additional time.”  He added, however, “What really matters here is that the president of the United States supports this agreement, and our system of government works in such a way that everyone follows what the president says.”  U.S. defense officials said they have begun working out some of the details, even though they are hamstrung by existing U.S. law that prohibits any military-to-military relations with Russia in the aftermath of Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.  Defense Secretary Ash Carter must submit a waiver to Congress along with a report detailing why military cooperation with Russia is necessary. U.S. officials said Carter hasn’t done that yet, and he likely won’t until the required cease-fire and humanitarian aid conditions are met for seven days.  Until then, officials said the U.S. military team setting up the JIC will not be able to meet with their Russian counterparts. The U.S. officials laid out a number of questions that must be resolved before any targeting could start, including how much control either country may have over strikes taken by the other, how the review process will unfold and the question of whether either Washington or Moscow will have a veto over any target in dispute — and who would be the final arbiter in any such disagreements.  Other officials have said they believe there is no veto authority on either side, and that the U.S. would bear no responsibility if a Russian strike killed civilians. And they have made it clear that the U.S. would end the cooperation if Russia violated the agreement and killed civilians or U.S. allies.  A key question will be where the military will get the additional surveillance aircraft needed. Drones, in particular, are in high demand around the world, and commanders in volatile regions including Asia and the Middle East, won’t be eager to give up theirs.  The U.S. hasn’t targeted much in some portions of Syria, including around Aleppo and regions where al-Qaida-linked militants are centered. The additional surveillance and analysis will be needed to identify and vet those targets to ensure friendly forces and innocent people aren’t mixed in.  Military officials said that even once the proposed U.S.-Russian center is set up, airstrikes won’t start happening immediately. They said it will take time to share and analyze the recommended target data and make certain that innocent civilians or allies aren’t hit.  It can take weeks for a particular enemy target to get approved and added to the air-tasking order that the U.S.-led coalition uses to assign airstrikes in Iraq and Syria.

87,NOT_STRIKE," The Trump administration’s quiet decision this week to roll back part of an Obama-era transparency rule that mandated reporting of civilian casualties from airstrikes has renewed the stark debate over who dies, and how, in U.S. military action abroad.  Many current and former national security officials have defended the move, calling the 2016 executive order onerous and redundant.A spokesman from the National Security council said on Wednesday that the decision eliminates “superfluous reporting requirements that do not improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission.”  But the move alarmed former intelligence officials and experts who argue that the key abilities to oversee an important piece of U.S. military and covert action abroad will now be left in the dark, now that non-military agencies, notably the CIA, will no longer be required to publicly report on casualties resulting from drone strikes and other covert operations. The decision could “remove the lens into the most opaque of all of U.S. airstrikes,” said Marc Garlasco, a former UN war crimes investigator.  What did the Obama-era policy do?  President Barack Obama greatly expanded the United States’ targeted killing program, using new technologies to carry out what were often deadly covert operations. During his presidency, by one count from the Council on Foreign Relations, Obama authorized 540 drone strikes that killed hundreds of civilians across Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, among other countries. While he expanded drone use, Obama, who was heavily criticized for the policy, also signed the 2016 executive order on civilian casualties to make drone strikes more transparent.  The order was written to address a need “to understand how the U.S. deals with the risk of civilian casualties,” said Larry Lewis, who worked on the order under former President Barack Obama and is now the research director at the Center for Naval Analyses. The executive order was also designed to respond to a “call for greater transparency from the civilian toll” of U.S. counterterrorism operations, Lewis added.  The executive order was an unprecedented step towards boosting transparency around secret operations, and set a new standard for U.S. allies as well, Garlasco said. “What we’re losing in this is leadership,” he said of the Trump administration’s decision, noting that other countries will no longer look to the U.S. as a leader on the issue.      The move has alarmed former intelligence officials and experts who argue the U.S. will lose oversight over an important element of action abroad.   Garlasco cited as an example a report put out by the British Royal Air Force this week that cited only one civilian casualty killed in Iraq and Syria in the past five years, a number many experts dismissed as implausibly low .  Why did Trump roll the policy back?  Even critics of the change said they saw some logic in the Trump administration’s decision to repeal the reporting requirement. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires the administration to submit an annual report on civilian casualties to Congress that is, in some ways, more comprehensive than the kind of reporting required by the executive order. The report required by the defense authorization act includes a record of “not only civilian deaths but also civilians wounded,” as well as a breakdown of operations by region, Lewis said.  But Lewis argued there will now be a reporting gap when it comes to non-military operations, including the CIA — and that is what most concerns some analysts and human rights professionals.  Steven Aftergood, a project director with the Federation of American Scientists, a group that analyzes security threats through a scientific lens, said the Trump administration’s decision “lowers the standard of accountability” for the government. This comes at a time when the CIA is looking to carry out more drone strikes in parts of Africa, according to reporting by the New York Times.  President Donald Trump talks to reporters as he departs to visit storm-hit areas of Alabama from the White House on March 8, 2019. Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters  “No one wants civilian casualties, neither the military nor the CIA,” Aftergood said. “But by reducing access to information about casualties, it makes it harder to hold the government accountable that things go wrong.”  Others said the change is especially worrisome given news reports that the Trump administration lowered an Obama-era threshold in the fall of 2017 for conducting drone strikes in non-combat zones. If that’s true, said Rita Siemion, an international legal counsel for Human Rights First, it would make the reporting requirement on non-military action even more important.  “Now that the rules have been loosened, it’s important that we know the consequences. Without this reporting, it’s really hard to know,” Siemion said.  Covert strikes are “something we should want to know about, particularly when it has to do with killing people in foreign countries that we’re not at war with,” Garlasco added. “When you remove a public reporting requirement, you greatly decrease the likelihood that they’re going to do it.”  What this means for agencies  Even when the entire Obama-era executive order was in effect, the civilian casualty reports released to the public were imperfect. The first report after the order went into force   estimated that between 64 and 116 civilians had been killed in airstrikes since 2009 — well below numbers released by organizations such as the New America Foundation and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which estimated that more than 250 civilians had been killed by these operations.  “There’s inherent uncertainty,” said Lewis, noting that when buildings are hit, it’s difficult for agencies to estimate how many individual deaths result from these airstrikes.  But while the reports can never give a complete picture of the human toll of U.S. operations abroad, Lewis and others stressed that they can help agencies better assess their strategies and make changes to reduce civilian deaths.  “Even more important than the number is having a serious process that tries to learn the mistakes that have been made,” Lewis said. A major objective of the Obama executive order was to have the government “go back and look at what trends were happening and what problems were being encountered, and try to learn from that,” he said.  A report released in late 2017, which examined English language news reports through November of that year, said there was a 42 percent increase in civilian deaths compared to the same timeframe in 2016. This indicates the government has not made a significant effort to reassess its strategy, Lewis said.  “Without the investigation, accounting, amends, and lessons learned, we will continue to see civilian deaths in these legally gray operations,” Garlasco said.

CTD official Rai Tahir identified the two militants as Adeel Hafeez and Usman Haroon. He said both were killed during an intense shootout in the raid conducting by security officials.  Tahir said officials had, in the past, foiled other attacks the pair had plotted, adding that they were also behind the killing of two intelligence officials in recent years as well as other high-profile crimes.  The two militants were also linked to the 2011 Al Qaeda abduction of an American development worker , Warren Weinstein, the official said. Weinstein, who was taken from Lahore, was accidentally killed in a United States drone strike in 2015 on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. He provided no specific information about the role the two had in Weinstein's case.  The American worker's accidental death was announced by Washington in 2015.

12764,NOT_STRIKE," A Paris court on Tuesday opened France’s first trial of a suspect in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The trial is of major significance — judicially and diplomatically, but also symbolically — for France, which has been criticized for its role in the genocide and for harboring its perpetrators in the 20 years since.  Pascal Simbikangwa, a former Rwandan army and intelligence chief, stands accused of arming and instructing the extremist militias and Rwandan army at roadblocks in Rwanda during the genocide. Simbikangwa faces charges of complicity in genocide and complicity in crimes against humanity.  Roadblock attacks were part of a well-organized campaign that resulted in the deaths of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over the course of just 100 days. Wielding machetes, the extremist Hutu militia, known as the Interahamwe, stationed barricades, where they checked identity cards and beat and maimed passers-by.  Sometimes called “the torturer,” Simbikangwa would command people to crouch beside him so that he could beat them at his level, according to Philip Gourevitch, author of the 1998 book about the genocide “We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families.” Simbikangwa, 54, was paralyzed from the waist down after a 1980s car crash, but his disability reportedly did not diminish his stature in the regime’s inner circle.  He was also reportedly one of the instrumental forces behind Radio Television Libre des Milles Collines — the extremist propaganda station that blared orders to kill Tutsti “cockroaches” across Rwanda’s capital city of Kigali.  Five years ago, Simbikangwa was living under an alias on France’s Indian Ocean island of Mayotte, when he was discovered by a French couple, Alain Gauthier and his wife Dafroza, a chemical engineer from Rwanda. The two have made it their mission to track down suspected genocide perpetrators living in France.  The expected seven-week trial is made possible by 1996 and 2010 laws that grant French courts near-universal jurisdiction for exceptional crimes. If convicted, Simbikangwa could face a life in prison.  Charges of complicity, Gourevitch told the NewsHour, seem “oddly softened,” especially when in Rwanda, the directors of the killing are typically viewed as bearing more responsibility than the hatchet men.  On day one of the trial, Simbikangwa’s lawyers argued that the prosecution’s case is built on unverified witness accounts. The defense has also objected to the unusual move to film the trial, recordings of which the prosecution wants to be made available after its completion.  While the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania, has sought to try Rwanda’s genocidaires, France has been reluctant to turn over any perpetrators. French courts will not allow Simbikangwa to be extradited to Rwanda.  Indeed, the significance of this case, according to Gourevitch and other observers of Franco-African relations, is that it’s in France. Ten years ago, when the Arusha tribunals were still in full throttle, Simbikangwa would have been a big enough catch to send there. But he’s nowhere near the biggest catch, and yet already, Gourevitch noted, his case is garnering more international press than some of the U.N. tribunals.  France has long protected Rwanda’s Hutu extremists as clients, so for them to put someone like Simbikangwa on trial is a change, Gourevitch said.  A French Justice Ministry spokesman called it the first trial in France on charges of genocide. The proceedings carry a symbolic weight, as the AP noted , in a country where the collaborationist regime helped the Nazis persecute Jews.  But France’s decision to try Simbikangwa and not to send him to Rwanda, Gourevitch said, is less about France confronting its own legacy, and more about “France dealing with the reality of the genocide.” That’s a diplomatic decision, he continued, given that other European countries, like Norway and Belgium, have tried genocide suspects well before this year’s 20th anniversary.  The Rwandan government welcomed Tuesday’s trial. “It is history being made. We have always wondered why it has taken 20 years... it is late, but it is a good sign,” said Rwandan Justice Minister Johnston Busingye.  There are another 27 cases related to the Rwandan genocide on the Paris court’s war crimes and crimes against humanity dockets, including one against the former first lady of Rwanda, Agathe Habyarimana , who was arrested by French police in Paris in 2010. Her husband, President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed when his plane was shot down in Rwanda on April 6, 1994. This event has been widely credited with precipitating the mass killing.  Habyarimana was a close ally of French President Francois Mitterrand, who supported the Rwandan president with arms and money and overlooked many of his government’s abuses — the kind of post-colonial alliance that defined the politics of “Francafrique.”  In the wake of Habyarimana’s death, extremist Hutus set up an intermediary government to carry out their genocidal campaign. Simbikangwa served in both of these governments, to which France lent support. Paris did little to stop the mass killing in the spring of 1994, and Mitterrand, as the French newspaper Le Figaro later quoted him, is famous for saying at the time, “In such countries, genocide is not too important.”  Rwanda and France have only recently renewed relations, after Rwanda cut their ties when a French judge concluded that English-speaking Tutsi forces, led by current President Paul Kagame, targeted Habyarimana’s plane. In 2010, French President Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged France had made “grave errors of judgement” with regard to the genocide, but did not issue a formal apology.

In 2007, he suffered serious injuries in an encounter with militants in Bannu and had to be transported to Peshawar in a helicopter for medical treatment. He was serving as the Cantonment Police Station's station house officer at the time.  In 2009, he survived a suicide attack near his office in Bannu, where he was posted as the deputy superintendent of police.

This comes as the Afghan security forces are busy conducting counter-terrorism operations against the IS and other insurgent groups in this province. The US forces based in Afghanistan also support the Afghan forces in their fight against the terrorist groups and often carry out airstrikes to suppress the insurgency of the terror groups. The increased raids by the Afghan and US forces followed rampant activities by the IS and other groups to expand their insurgency in this key eastern province.

14547,NOT_STRIKE,"ROME (Reuters) - A special tribunal has recommended that Interior Minister Matteo Salvini face trial for refusing to let 150 migrants disembark last year from a rescue ship docked in Sicily, the far-right leader said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini gestures as he attends a news conference in Rome, Italy, January 14, 2019. REUTERS/Remo Casilli/File Photo The court, which reviews investigations involving government ministers, overturned a previous recommendation by prosecutors to drop the politically charged case. “I risk between 3 and 15 years in jail for having blocked illicit migrants from coming to Italy. I am speechless,” Salvini wrote on Twitter. “I ask the Italian people: Should I continue to be the minister, exercising my rights and duties, or should I ask this or that court to (decide) immigration policy?” Following the court move, Italy’s upper-house Senate will now be called on to decide whether Salvini can be tried. Salvini was placed under investigation last August for alleged abuse of power and holding people against their will after he denied permission for the Italian coastguard ship Diciotti to let a group of mainly Eritrean migrants disembark. The migrants were eventually allowed to land, but since then Salvini has tightened the screws and is refusing to let any rescue ships into Italian ports, saying other European states should pick up the strain. “Let me be totally clear. I will not change my position in the slightest. Boats, little boats, big boats. No one will get off the boats in Italy,” said Salvini, who is head of the League party and also serves as deputy prime minister. His determination looks set to be tested in coming days with SeaWatch 3, a vessel run by a German humanitarian group, which is heading towards Italy in stormy seas and carrying 47 migrants picked up on Saturday off Libya. “We’re facing a Mediterranean cyclone, a rather rare weather phenomenon with waves of 7 metres, rain and icy wind,” the group wrote on Twitter, asking for shelter. Salvini called it “the latest provocation” and said the NGO vessel should dock in Malta, which has also repeatedly refused to let migrants disembark. His fellow deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, said the boat should head to France. Italy has taken in more than 650,000 boat migrants since 2014, but the influx has slowed dramatically since the new government took office last June. Salvini’s uncompromising approach has been backed by many Italians and recent opinion polls say his League party is now the most popular in the country. However, he has faced criticism from opposition politicians and the centre-left mayor of Palermo offered to let the SeaWatch migrants come to his city, the capital of Sicily. “Palermo is an open and welcoming city and is ready to play its part in bringing this affair to a positive conclusion,” Leoluca Orlando wrote in an open letter to the skipper of the NGO boat, saying international law was on their side. The Sea-Watch spent more than two weeks at sea over the New Year holidays with 32 migrants on board before Malta finally relented and allowed it to dock.

5638,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — Iraq’s battle to reclaim Mosul from the Islamic State group is progressing despite “stiff” resistance from resilient and creative fighters, but a coming offensive to oust them from their main Syria stronghold at Raqqa poses tougher political challenges and could take longer, the U.S. commander of anti-IS coalition forces said Wednesday.  Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend also said American intelligence has detected indistinct signs of Islamic State plotting against the West from Raqqa, adding urgency to coalition plans to encircle and eventually assault the city.   “We know they’re up to something, and it’s an external plot,” the general told reporters at the Pentagon, speaking from his headquarters in Baghdad. “We don’t know exactly where” they intend to strike, he added. “We don’t know exactly when.”  “We know this plot-and-planning is emanating from Raqqa. We think we’ve got to get to Raqqa pretty soon.” He declined to be more precise about a timeline but said there is “a sense of urgency” due to the uncertainty of the threat.  As the Islamic State group’s two main hubs, Mosul and Raqqa have long loomed as potentially decisive battles. The group has lost considerable territory elsewhere in both Iraq and Syria over the past year, and the U.S. and its coalition partners see collapsing their last major strongholds as a key to extinguishing extremist claims to a caliphate.  Townsend and other coalition leaders are struggling with the timing for Raqqa, not only because of the demands of the large Iraqi-led Mosul operation but also because the political and military landscape in Syria is more complicated. Townsend said more Syrian opposition fighters need to be recruited, trained and equipped for the Raqqa battle, but he and other officials have said in recent days that the Mosul and Raqqa operations will overlap.  “I think it will be within weeks,” Defense Secretary Ash Carter said in Brussels, adding, “Not many weeks.”  Unlike in Iraq, where the coalition has a coherent government to work with, the U.S. and its coalition partners in Syria are relying on a hodge-podge of local Arab and Kurdish opposition groups, some of whom are fierce rivals. The tensions are exacerbated by the presence of Russian and Syrian forces on one side and Turkish forces on another.  “It’s probably fair to say with the complexity and the fact that we haven’t really got it underway yet that it’ll probably take longer than Mosul,” Townsend said, referring to the Raqqa offensive. He and other officials have avoided predicting how long it will take to oust IS from Mosul, but they have suggested it could take a number of months.  Townsend acknowledged that a ground offensive in Raqqa is politically fraught, given the diverse and competing ethnic groups in Syria and demands by Turkey that the Syrian Kurdish fighting force known as the YPG, which the Turks regard as an enemy, not participate in the Raqqa assault.  He said plainly that the YPG will necessarily be part of the offensive.  “The facts are these: The only force that is capable on any near-term timeline is the Syrian Democratic Forces, of which the YPG are a significant portion,” Townsend said. “So, we’re negotiating, we’re planning, we’re having talks with Turkey and we’re gonna take this in steps. And we think there’s an imperative to get isolation in place around Raqqa because our intelligence feeds tell us that there is significant external operations attacks planning going on, centralized in Raqqa.”   The battle for Mosul is the most important of the two-year campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq. Judy Woodruff speaks with retired Gen. David Petraeus, former commander of the Multi-National Force Iraq, about the current combat mission, as well as what he says is the greater challenge of governance of the region after ISIS has been dislodged.  Townsend gave a mostly upbeat assessment of progress in the Iraqi push toward Mosul, which began last week. The extremists, who have controlled Mosul for more than two years, are “fighting very hard,” offering “pretty stiff resistance,” he said.  “They’ve pulled out all stops,” he said, including suicide attacks, car bombs, mortars and roadside bombs. He credited IS with innovative uses of small drones. “It’s not episodic or sporadic,” he said. “It’s relatively constant and creative.”  The drones, which he called “a pretty thorny problem,” are being used not only for surveillance and to guide mortar or artillery fire but also as Trojan horses. Townsend cited an example of an IS drone landing, seemingly harmlessly, behind Iraqi lines. It exploded when Iraqi soldiers picked it up for examination, killing or wounding them, Townsend said.  “We expect to see more of this,” he said.  Townsend said the indications of IS plotting Western attacks from Raqqa have not caused the coalition to accelerate its Raqqa operation. He outlined a phased approach to spoiling the plots, starting with “trying to head it off” by using airstrikes against targets around Raqqa.  “We’re going to do those kinds of suppressive fires until we’re ready to mount an approach and isolation of Raqqa,” he said.  Once the city is isolated, he said, a ground offensive will be launched to expel IS from the city it regards as its capital.  Townsend said some aspects of the Raqqa assault plan are yet to be worked out and will be decided by local commanders.  “Syrian commanders will make decisions about what needs to be done there to completely encircle, to partially encircle and to attack from this direction or attack from that direction,” he said. “They’ll make those decisions. We haven’t reached that stage of the planning with them yet.”  WATCH: Petraeus says there’s a bigger challenge to come once Iraq retakes Mosul from ISIS ",False,2016-10-26 21:07:00+00:00,2019-03-23 02:52:12.004380+00:00,5639,True,1,"U.S. general: Mosul battle is hard, but Raqqa will be harder",https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-general-mosul-battle-hard-raqqa-will-harder

International criticism against an Israeli raid on a humanitarian flotilla delivering aid to the Gaza Strip intensified on Tuesday, as the United Nations Security Council issued a statement against the operation that resulted in nine deaths and called for an impartial investigation into the incident.  “The Security Council deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries resulting form the use of force during the Israeli military operation in international waters against the convoy sailing to Gaza,” the statement read in part .   It was reached following a marathon negotiating session that lasted nearly 12 hours. As the BBC reports :  “The UN statement was the result of a compromise between Turkey and the United States, with Turkey reluctant to water down its trenchant criticism of Israel while the United States, Israel’s closest ally, wanted to temper the language used.”  Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that four Turkish citizens were among the dead .  Reports from Cairo said Egypt had offered a temporary easing of its own restrictions, opening its border with Gaza for a limited period to permit humanitarian aid to reach the 1.5 million people there.  Meantime, Israel continued its defense of Monday’s raid , releasing a video showing its soldiers being attacked with metal poles and chairs while attempting to board one of the ships in the flotilla.  The aid mission’s organizers, meanwhile, were preparing a second attempt to breach Israel’s naval blockade of Gaza.  Foreign Policy’s Blake Hounshell explains “Why the Gaza boat deaths are a big deal”:  [T]here’s a huge unwillingness on the Israeli right to face reality — that Israel is fast losing friends and allies in the world, and that this government in Jerusalem has only accelerated the shift. It’s not hard to imagine boycott campaigns gaining momentum, damaging the Israeli economy and isolating the country diplomatically, especially in Europe.  BP Facing $990 Million Bill  With BP’s costs for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill now at $990 million, the company is preparing as early as Wednesday to begin yet another attempt to plug the six-week-old leak.

This time around, however, BP engineers say they have resolved some of the technical problems that forced them to abandon the first attempt.  The Associate Press notes :  “The best hope for stopping the flow of oil from the blown-out well...has been compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate with a drill more than two miles into the earth, and is anything but a sure bet on the first attempt.”  While BP readies for the so-called cut-and-cap operation, Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to the Gulf Coast on Tuesday to survey the spill and meet with the attorneys general from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi to determine whether federal criminal charges should be filed against BP.

3345,NOT_STRIKE," In his State of the Union address Tuesday, President Donald Trump once again touched on the growing tensions between his White House and North Korea, calling Kim Jong Un’s regime “depraved” and saying its “reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland.”  In a speech heavy on domestic issues, including taxes, infrastructure and immigration, the president also announced he had signed an executive order to keep Guantanamo Bay prison open – reversing the actions of his predecessor – and was working to fix unfair trade deals. “The era of economic surrender is totally over,” he said.   Watch the full State of the Union in the player above.  We asked experts what they learned — and what they didn’t — from Trump’s remarks on global issues during his first State of the Union.  Despite more strong rhetoric, Trump didn’t say anything new about his North Korea policy, said Frank Aum, senior expert on North Korea at the U.S. Institute of Peace. Instead, he echoed past themes of “using ‘maximum pressure’ to prevent North Korea from achieving a nuclear missile capability and sought to draw a sharp distinction between his policy and the approaches of past administrations,” Aum said.  Frank Aum  “But Trump, underscoring a main point of his speech last year in Seoul, did emphasize human rights. He extrapolated the depraved character of the North Korean regime, using the tragic examples of Otto Warmbier and a North Korean defector named Ji Seong-ho, to underscore that the threat applies to everyone, including the United States and its allies,” said Aum. Trump did not mention diplomacy or engagement anywhere in the North Korea section of the speech.  The bigger news on North Korea, noted Aum, is that the nomination of Victor Cha for U.S. ambassador to South Korea will not be going forward. (Read the full report in the Washington Post.) Why? “He raised concerns about the administration’s consideration of a limited strike on North Korea,” Aum said. “If true, this report reveals the seriousness with which the administration is looking at military options as well as a problematic litmus test for future ambassadorial nominees.”  While pledging to fight until the Islamic State group is defeated, “the president did not address the more salient foreign policy question that preoccupies Middle Easterners (Arabs and Israelis alike): Who and what will fill the vacuum created by ISIS’ defeat?” said Robert Danin, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations and at the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center’s Future of Diplomacy Project. “Specifically, will the United States remain engaged in the Middle East, and will the Trump administration devote resources — diplomatic, economic, or military — towards addressing the brutal conflict in Syria that has destabilized the region?” Robert Danin  Trump highlighted his decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but did not say how that “will help advance the goal of forging ‘the ultimate deal’ between Israelis and Palestinians,” Danin said. That’s striking because that is how he explained this policy shift in December. Instead, he registered his irritation at “countries that voted their disapproval of the Jerusalem recognition in the United Nations General Assembly, asking Congress to withhold foreign assistance money from those countries that are not America’s friends,” said Danin. Trump offered support for anti-regime Iranian protesters and criticized the Iran nuclear deal, “yet he provided no alternative vision or policies for Iran other than to reaffirm that he has asked Congress — rather than his own administration — to address the Iran deal’s flaws,” Danin said. “Nor did Trump address Iran’s regional expansionism, or provide any sense of American intention to counter Tehran’s nefarious intentions.” “For those who know the Twitter President, it was a pleasure to see Donald Trump using complete sentences, uttering complete thoughts, ignoring his adversaries, championing real people, real heroes, and glorying in his nation, not his ego,” said Danielle Pletka, senior vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. But for those who care deeply about the safety and security of the American people, and the moral leadership of the United States in the world, it was light on substance, she said.  Danielle Pletka  Trump took close to an hour to get to national security, Pletka said, and while he highlighted some countries, he left many others out. “If we are with the people of Iran, let us also ask what of the people of Syria? Or China? What about the growing authoritarian threat of Russia, of Turkey, or of the specter of al-Qaida, flourishing even as ISIS fades?”  Is Trump “indifferent to those foreigners because we are about making America and Americans great again? Fair; but remember that every unfinished victory in Syria and Iraq, every drone strike in Afghanistan, leaves a vacuum that must be filled by something,” she said. “A great American leader will fashion strategies that ensure that ISIS and al Qaeda don’t return. A great American leader will remember that it is our values that distinguish us most, and mean we must stand up to the genuine threat that the People’s Republic of China and Putin’s Russia represent,” she added.  “If that leadership and those values were what you were listening for, you were sorely disappointed.”  But, according to James Carafano, The Heritage Foundation’s vice president of foreign and defense policy studies, the speech showed that “most of the concerns about the Trump approach to foreign policy have proven unfounded.  James Carafano  “The talk matches the walk. He is not an isolationist. He has not abandoned America’s friend and allies. He has not walked away from global institutions like the United Nations,” Carafano said.  “If anything, putting aside the tweets and off-hand comments, much of Trump’s foreign policy looks more traditional than that of President Bush or President Obama,” he continued. Trump “is not trying to reshape the world in America’s image, nor is he walking away from the responsibility to protect U.S. interests — like safeguarding Americans from nuclear blackmail by North Korea.”  On funding the military, Carafano added that while it is laudable that the president is forward-leaning in protecting American interests in places like the Middle East and Asia, he also noted the importance of ‘peace through strength.’ American strategy isn’t all about military action, but a strong military is foundational to a strong America and Trump is right to press Congress to fully fund the defense of the nation.”  Read the full address here .

500,NOT_STRIKE," VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis said Wednesday that fear of migration is “making us crazy” as he began a trip to Central America amid a standoff over President Donald Trump’s promised wall at the U.S.-Mexico border and a new caravan of migrants heading north.  Francis was asked by reporters about the proposed border wall Wednesday on the way to Panama, where he is looking to leave the sex abuse scandals buffeting his papacy behind. Francis responded: “It is the fear that makes us crazy.”  READ MORE: Trump says there’s a ‘crisis’ at the border. Here’s what the data says  The Roman Catholic Church’s first Latin American pope and the son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, Francis has made the plight of migrants and refugees a cornerstone of his papacy. He is also expected to offer words of encouragement to young people gathered in Panama for World Youth Day, the church’s once-every-three-year pep rally that aims to invigorate the next generation of Catholics in their faith.  Panama Archbishop Jose Domingo Ulloa said Francis’ message is likely to resonate with young Central Americans who see their only future free of violence and poverty in migrating to the U.S. — “young people who often fall into the hands of drug traffickers and so many other realities that our young people face.”  The pope is expected to urge young people to create their own opportunities, while calling on governments do their share as well.  The visit is taking place as the U.S. government remains partly shut down in a standoff between the Trump administration and Democrats over funding for Trump’s promised border wall.  Francis famously has called for “bridges, not walls.” After celebrating Mass in 2016 on the Mexican side of the U.S. border, he denounced anyone who wants to build a wall to keep out migrants as “not Christian.”  Crowds are expected to be smaller than usual for this World Youth Day — only about 150,000 people had registered as of last week — but thousands more will certainly throng Francis’ main events, which include a vigil and a final Mass on Sunday. The Vatican conceded that the January date doesn’t suit school vacations in Europe or North America, both of which typically send huge numbers of pilgrims to World Youth Day gatherings.  Francis’ trip, the first in a year packed with foreign travel, comes at a critical moment in the papacy as the Catholic hierarchy globally is facing a crisis in credibility for covering up decades of cases of priests molesting young people.  The pope is expected to soon rule on the fate of former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the high-powered U.S. archbishop accused of molesting minors and adults. And he is hosting church leaders at the Vatican next month on trying to chart a way forward for the global church.  Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said there were no plans for Francis to meet with abuse survivors in Panama. Central America hasn’t yet seen the explosion of sex abuse cases that have shattered trust in the Catholic hierarchy in Chile, the U.S. and other parts of the world.  This is the first papal visit to Panama since St. John Paul II was there during a 1983 regional tour that famously included an unscheduled stop at the tomb of Archbishop Oscar Romero in El Salvador. Romero had been gunned down by right-wing death squads three years earlier, at the start of El Salvador’s civil war, for having spoken out on behalf of the poor.  Salvadoran bishops had hoped Francis would follow suit and make a stop in El Salvador this time to pay his respects at Romero’s tomb since Francis canonized him in October. But the Vatican said a Salvador leg was never really in the cards.  Nevertheless, Gisotti said Romero would likely loom large at the Panama gathering, given he is such a point of reference for young Central American Catholics who grew up learning about his defense of the poor.  The Panama visit is also the first by a pope since the Vatican embassy played a crucial role during the 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama, when dictator Manuel Noriega took refuge there and requested asylum on Christmas Eve after four days on the run trying to escape U.S. troops.  Noriega eventually surrendered, bringing to an end one of the more unusual U.S. military operations: It involved U.S. troops blasting heavy metal and rock music — including Van Halen’s “Panama” — at the embassy to try to force Noriega out.  Noriega, a onetime U.S. ally, eventually served a 17-year drug sentence in the United States. He died in 2017 after his final years were spent in a Panamanian prison for the murder of political opponents during his 1983-89 regime.  Pope Francis confirmed to reporters aboard the papal plane that he plans to go to Japan in November. The pope also said he wants to visit Iraq, but that local church leaders have told him that the security situation is not yet right.  This year, the pontiff has already scheduled trips to United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bulgaria and Macedonia, and a trip to Madagascar is rumored.  READ MORE: Trump says walls work.

2550,NOT_STRIKE,"BAGHOUZ, Syria (Reuters) - Islamic State launched two counter-attacks on U.S.-backed fighters besieging their final shred of territory in eastern Syria on Wednesday but were beaten back without any progress, the Syrian Democratic Forces said. FILE PHOTO: Fighters of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stand near Islamic state fighters and their families who surrendered in the village of Baghouz, Deir Al Zor province, Syria March 12, 2019. REUTERS/Rodi Said The jihadists, waging a last-ditch battle in Baghouz, a collection of hamlets and farmland near the Iraqi border, dispatched suicide bombers against SDF fighters, who thwarted the attacks, the U.S.-backed force said. Islamic State launched the second counter-attack in the afternoon, “(taking) advantage of smoke and dust over Baghouz”, the SDF media office said. “Fighting is still continuing. (Islamic State) made no progress so far and were stopped.” Mustafa Bali, head of the SDF media office, said the heavy clashes led to the death of 38 militants including eight suicide bombers while four SDF fighters were killed. There were advances on some points, Bali said. Black smoke mushroomed high over Baghouz as the sounds of gunfire, explosions and planes could be heard in a battle that the SDF has said is as good as over. In parts of Baghouz already under SDF control, dirt roads were littered with the scorched remains of cars, trucks and motorcycles. Many houses had been completely flattened and roads had been cratered by missile strikes. Islamic State’s black flag could still be seen painted on walls, while others had been emblazoned with freshly daubed SDF slogans and the words “Down with Daesh”, an Arabic acronym for the jihadists. Islamic State (IS) held roughly one third of Syria and Iraq at the zenith of its power in 2014, when its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared himself “caliph”, or leader of all the world’s Muslims. Subsequently, IS was steadily beaten back by a range of enemies including the U.S.-led international coalition, suffering its major defeats in 2017 when it lost the Iraqi city of Mosul and its Syrian headquarters at Raqqa. No Islamic State leaders are believed to be in Baghouz, according to a U.S. defence official. U.S. government experts strongly believe Baghdadi is alive and possibly hiding in Iraq. The group is still assessed to remain a potent security threat operating in remote territory in both Syria and Iraq. Bali said SDF forces had bombarded Baghouz heavily overnight before engaging in direct clashes with IS fighters in the pre-dawn hours. Live footage broadcast by Kurdish Ronahi TV showed a series of large blasts lighting up the night sky over Baghouz. SUICIDE ASSAULTS “There were suicide vest attacks by a group of bombers who tried to blow themselves up amidst our forces. Our forces targeted and killed them before they reached our positions,” Bali said. The SDF has laid siege to Baghouz for weeks but had repeatedly postponed its final assault to allow thousands of civilians, many of them wives and children of Islamic State fighters, to leave. It resumed the attack on Sunday. The U.S. led aerial coalition campaign to end the militants’ last territorial enclave has exacted a heavy human toll with hundreds of casualties among civilians from intense aerial bombardment that has razed many villages to the ground, former residents and aid workers say. Around 3,000 IS fighters and their families surrendered to SDF forces in 24 hours, Bali said overnight. Three women and four children belonging to the Yazidi sect, a minority group who were kidnapped and enslaved by IS in 2014, were also freed, he said. Islamic State put out a new propaganda video overnight Monday filmed in recent weeks inside Baghouz, maintaining its claim to leadership of all Muslims and calling on its supporters to keep the faith. “Tomorrow, God willing, we will be in paradise and they will be burning in hell,” one of the men interviewed in the video said. [nL8N20Z23H] Though Islamic State is on the verge of losing its last piece of territory, Syria remains carved up among other parties to its multi-sided conflict: President Bashar al-Assad’s government, the Kurdish-led SDF, and anti-government rebels. The war has escalated in recent weeks with the Assad government stepping up its shelling of opposition held towns in the northwestern region of Idlib, where Islamist militant group Tahrir al-Sham holds sway.

Russian warplanes struck for the first time in months the centre of Idlib city, including a hospital and a prison on the  outskirts from which dozens of inmates fled, residents said. The Russian defence ministry said they targeted a weapons store by Tahrir al Sham where it said the jihadists planned a drone attack on a Russian air base near the Mediterranean.

It has been a source of public anger and last month, in its US policy review, Pakistan decided to ask US to stop the attacks.

In the meantime some of the documents seized Navy SEALs at the bin Laden compound will be made public online this week by the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, he said.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday that revoked an Obama-era policy requiring U.S. intelligence officials to report civilian deaths in drone strikes outside of active war zones. President Barack Obama put the policy in place in 2016 as part of an effort to be more transparent about drone strikes after he had dramatically increased their use against Islamist militants. Trump’s rescinding of the policy was done with little fanfare. The White House released the text of his executive order. “This action eliminates superfluous reporting requirements, requirements that do not improve government transparency, but rather distract our intelligence professionals from their primary mission,” an administration official said. The Obama policy had required the U.S. director of national intelligence to release by May 1 each year an unclassified summary of the number of strikes undertaken by the United States against militant targets outside areas of active hostilities. “The United States government is fully committed to complying with its obligations under the law of armed conflict, minimizing, to the greatest extent possible, civilian casualties, and acknowledging responsibility when they unfortunately occur during military operations,” the administration official said. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, in a statement called the requirement issued by Obama “an important measure of transparency,” and said “there is simply no justification” for cancelling it. “Today’s decision underscores the need for Congress to make this reporting mandatory, something I intend to pursue through the Intelligence Authorization Act this year,” he said.

The horrific execution video was released earlier in the month of August last year which purportedly showed the ISIS loyalists forcing the men to sit on landmines and subsequently detonating the explosives. The loyalists of the terror group claimed that the men were supporting the government and US forces and were looking to coordinate drone strikes against ISIS militants in Nangarhar. The death of Jangal Pacha comes as both the Afghan and US forces have stepped up raids against the loyalists of the terror group in this province.

The procession began in the early hours of Tuesday from the murder site in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg to a monastery commemorating the slain tsar, his German-born wife and five children, regional authorities said.  Many of the fervent believers came from across Russia and abroad to take part in the colourful ceremony during which many carried icons.  Another 20,000 people joined the commemorations when the procession arrived at the monastery in Ganina Yama after covering the distance of 21 kilometres, regional authorities said.  The monastery was built at one of the sites where the burnt bodies of the last Russian tsar and his family were taken after their execution in the aftermath of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, although they were later moved.  The Bolsheviks shot the abdicated tsar, his wife and their five children along with their servants and doctor on the night of July 16 to 17, 1918 as they were living under guard in the Urals city of Sverdlovsk, now Yekaterinburg.  Addressing the pilgrims, Patriarch Kirill said Russia should draw lessons “from this difficult and bitter experience.” “We truly should have lasting immunity against any ideas and any leaders who call on us to embrace some new, unknown happy future through the destruction of our life, our traditions and our faith,” the 71-year-old powerful Church leader said in a possible dig at the opposition to President Vladimir Putin.

AAP Image/David Crosling/via REUTERS MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Former Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell faces at least another three months in jail on child sex offences before his application for leave to appeal is heard on June 5 and 6. Pell, from Australia, is the world’s most senior Catholic priest to have been convicted on child sex offences. He was found guilty by a jury in Victoria in December on one charge of sexual assault against a 13-year-old boy and four charges of indecent acts against the same boy and another 13-year old. The events occurred 22 years earlier. The verdict could not be reported until last week, when a suppression order on the case was lifted as a result of further charges against the 77-year-old being dropped. His bail was revoked a week ago ahead of his sentencing on March 13. He faces a maximum of 10 years in jail for each of the charges. The Court of Appeal said on Wednesday a hearing on the application for leave to appeal was set for June 5 and 6. Pell is appealing his conviction on three grounds: the verdicts were “unreasonable”, the judge erred by not allowing the defence to show a video graphic in its closing address, and there was “a fundamental irregularity” as the accused was not arraigned in the presence of the jury panel. The application says the jury could not have been satisfied Pell was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as the prosecution’s case was based wholly on the word of one accuser, and more than 20 witnesses gave “unchallenged exculpatory evidence”. The other victim in the case died in 2014.

41015,NOT_STRIKE,"The former top American diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad has said Pakistan has been playing a dangerous game since the Taliban group was overthrown. In his testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Khalilzad said Pakistani proxies pose a severe threat to coalition and Afghan forces and civilians. “Indeed, Pakistani policy is the principal cause of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.” Khalilzad further added “More broadly, Pakistan’s use of extremist and terrorist proxies – including to threaten India — is a significant contributor to the global menace of Islamic extremism. It must be confronted if we are to succeed in defeating terrorism and extremism around the world.” He said since the overthrow of the Taliban regime after 9/11, Pakistan has been playing a perfidious and dangerous double game. It has portrayed itself as a U.S. partner, yet supports the Taliban and the al-Qaeda-linked Haqqani network. Since 2005, the Taliban and Haqqani network have regrouped in Pakistan and waged a devastating insurgency against U.S. and Afghan forces. According to Khalilzad, poor governance by the Afghan government is a factor in Kabul’s inability to defeat the insurgents. But the Taliban’s resilience can be attributed above all to the strategic decision of the Pakistani military and intelligence services to provide sanctuary and support to these groups. “Pakistan views the Taliban as an effective proxy to ensure Pakistani dominance over Afghanistan,” Khalilzad added. “Islamabad also believes that continuing the war in Afghanistan will lead to a U.S. withdrawal, which would change the balance of power against the current government and in favor of its proxies. Ultimately, Pakistan seeks the overthrow of the current government in Afghanistan because it is not compliant.” In his recommendations, Khalilzad said the May 21 killing of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in a U.S. drone strike has created a golden hour to confront Pakistan. Washington can force Islamabad to make a choice: U.S. aid and international support or a continued relationship with the Haqqani network and irreconcilable Taliban. “Catalyzing a decisive effect on Pakistani policy, however, will require the U.S. to escalate pressure on Islamabad,” Khalilzad said, adding that “Otherwise the opportunity will dissipate. For Islamabad to break with the Haqqani network and the Taliban, the Pakistani leadership needs to see that continued support for the insurgency will come at a high price.” He also added that escalating drone strikes against Haqqani and irreconcilable Taliban leaders would deliver that message, but drone strikes alone will not be enough without corresponding political and financial pressure. On the financial side, Khalilzad said Pakistan has been an enormous beneficiary of international support — specifically from Coalition support funds, bilateral assistance, and multilateral assistance from the IMF and World Bank. In addition to cutting off this assistance, Washington should warn Pakistan that it will face escalating financial sanctions—like those once imposed on Iran—unless it facilitates reconciliation talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. According to Khalilzad, as an initial step, the U.S. can impose financial and travel restrictions on senior Pakistani officials known to be complicit in the insurgency, and freeze funds in U.S. banks belonging to Pakistani entities—both military and corporate—involved in financing the Taliban. Politically, Pakistan cannot be a member in good standing of the international community so long as its agencies or military services aggress against Afghanistan, he added. Khalilzad said the U.N. Security Council is an appropriate venue in which to raise Pakistan’s aggression against Afghanistan. To help secure international support for a U.S.-Afghan-sponsored resolution condemning Pakistan, the U.S. should declassify and broadcast information indicating Pakistani support for the insurgency and its narcotics trafficking.

2547,NOT_STRIKE,"AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army, aided by Russian warplanes, attacked rebel-held towns in northwestern Syria on Wednesday in the most extensive bombardment in weeks against the last remaining rebel bastion in the country, rebels, rescuers and residents said. Rebels who have fought to topple President Bashar al-Assad for eight years are now largely confined to the enclave in the northwest near the Turkish border. Around four million people now live there, including hundreds of thousands of opponents of Assad who fled there from other parts of the country. The enclave is protected by a “de-escalation zone” agreement brokered last year by Assad’s main international backers Russia and Iran, and Turkey which has supported the rebels in the past and has sent troops to monitor the truce. Residents said at least 12 aerial raids had hit Idlib city, including a civilian prison on its outskirts, where they said dozens of prisoners escaped. At least four civilians were killed. Russia’s defence ministry confirmed it had hit Idlib in coordination with Turkey, targeting drones and weapons stores of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) jihadists it said were intended for use in an attack on a major Russian air base near the Mediterranean coast. [R4N20O02O] The Syrian army has escalated its shelling of the enclave since early February. The attacks have killed dozens of civilians and injured hundreds, and led to tens of thousands of people fleeing frontline areas to camps and towns closer to the Turkish border, rescuers and aid agencies said. The Syrian army denies targeting civilians and says the army is responding to stepped-up attacks staged by al Qaeda-inspired fighters who aim to wreck the truce and control the area. Residents along the border area with Turkey could hear heavy overnight aerial strikes that covered a wide stretch of territory from rebel-held areas near government-held Latakia province on the Mediterranean to Idlib city towards the east and extending to adjoining opposition-held parts of northern Hama. “They burnt the land... The sounds were heard very clearly,” said Ibrahim al Sheikh, a father of five in the border town of Atmeh. He quoted relatives as saying the shelling was the heaviest yet in the two weeks of escalation. The escalation in the northwest is taking place as a U.S.-backed Kurdish-led militia has launched a separate assault on the final bastion of Islamic State fighters on the opposite, eastern end of the country, creating turning points on both major fronts of Syria’s multi-sided civil war. ‘WHOEVER DID THIS IS A BEAST’ In the northwest, residents said white phosphorous munitions were fired overnight on the town of al Tamana in northwestern Idlib countryside, where rescue workers on Wednesday said they put out several fires caused by more than 80 rocket strikes. Among the targets of the aerial campaign was a makeshift tent camp in Kfr Amim, east of Idlib city, that shelters displaced families, where two women were killed and at least 10 children injured when bombs landed after midnight. “Whoever did this is a beast, truly a beast. It’s a camp with only women and children. There is nothing we can say except that this Russian beast is coming to kill,” said Laith al Abdullah, a civil defence worker in Sarqeb town who helped in the rescue effort, reached by mobile phone. Rocket shelling from a major army base in Joreen, in Hama province, escalated a week-long bombardment of rural areas near the town of Jisr al Shaqour, said Ahmed Abdul Salam, a rebel commander in the Turkey-backed National Liberation Front. A Russian army base, south of government-controlled Halafaya town, also targeted Kafr Zeita in northern Hama countryside while cluster bombs hit several rebel-held towns in southern Idlib, rebels said. The stepped-up bombardment has depopulated opposition-held towns in the buffer zone that straddles parts of Idlib to northern Hama and parts of Latakia province. The opposition-held city of Khan Sheikhon had become a ghost city with most of its more than 70,000 people fleeing, said Yousef al Idlibi, a former resident who moved to Idlib city. Turkey, which began patrols in the buffer zone on Friday, has condemned what it said were increasing provocations to wreck the truce, and warned that a bombing campaign by the Russians and the Syrian army would cause a major humanitarian crisis. Many residents are exasperated by the failure of Turkish forces to respond to the bombardments. The Syrian army has called for Turkish forces to withdraw.

3777,NOT_STRIKE," TORONTO — Former hostage Joshua Boyle said upon arriving back in Canada that the Haqqani network in Afghanistan had killed his infant daughter and raped his American wife during the years they were held in captivity.  Boyle gave the statement shortly after landing in Canada late Friday with his wife, Caitlan Coleman, and three young children.  The couple was rescued Wednesday, five years after they had been abducted by the Taliban-linked extremist network while in Afghanistan as part of a backpacking trip. Coleman was pregnant at the time and had four children in captivity. The birth of the fourth child had not been publicly known before Boyle appeared before journalists at the Toronto airport.  “The stupidity and evil of the Haqqani network’s kidnapping of a pilgrim and his heavily pregnant wife engaged in helping ordinary villagers in Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan was eclipsed only by the stupidity and evil of authorizing the murder of my infant daughter,” he said.  Boyle said his wife was raped by a guard who was assisted by his superiors. He asked for the Afghan government to bring them to justice.  “God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network,” he said.  He said he was in Afghanistan to help villagers “who live deep inside Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where no NGO, no aid worker and no government has ever successfully been able to bring the necessary help.”  On the plane from London, Boyle provided a written statement to The Associated Press saying his family has “unparalleled resilience and determination.”  Coleman, who is from Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, sat in the aisle of the business-class cabin wearing a tan-colored headscarf.  She nodded wordlessly when she confirmed her identity to a reporter on board the flight. In the two seats next to her were her two elder children. In the seat beyond that was Boyle, with their youngest child in his lap. U.S. State Department officials were on the plane with them.   The handwritten statement that Boyle gave the AP expressed disagreement with U.S. foreign policy.  “God has given me and my family unparalleled resilience and determination, and to allow that to stagnate, to pursue personal pleasure or comfort while there is still deliberate and organized injustice in the world would be a betrayal of all I believe, and tantamount to sacrilege,” he wrote.  He nodded to one of the State Department officials and said, “Their interests are not my interests.”  He added that one of his children is in poor health and had to be force-fed by their Pakistani rescuers.  The family was able to leave the plane with their escorts before the rest of the passengers. There was a short delay before everyone else was allowed out.  “It will be of incredible importance to my family that we are able to build a secure sanctuary for our three surviving children to call a home,” he said in his later statement at the airport. “To try to regain some portion of the childhood that they have lost.”  Dan Boyle, Joshua’s younger brother, said outside the family home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, that he had spoken to his brother a few times in the past few days.  “He’s doing very well. He sounds a lot like how he sounded five years ago. He sounds like he had his head on his shoulders and his wits about him,” he said.  The Canadian government said in a statement they will “continue to support him and his family now that they have returned.”  “Today, we join the Boyle family in rejoicing over the long-awaited return to Canada of their loved ones,” the Canadian government said.  Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nafees Zakaria, said the Pakistani raid that led to the family’s rescue was based on a tip from U.S. intelligence and shows that Pakistan will act against a “common enemy” when Washington shares information.  U.S. officials have long accused Pakistan of ignoring groups like the Haqqani network.  U.S. officials consider it a terrorist organization and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the Haqqani group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash.  A U.S. national security official, who was not authorized to discuss operational details of the release and spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. obtained actionable information, passed it to Pakistani government officials, asked them to interdict and recover the hostages — and they did.  President Donald Trump, who previously had warned Pakistan to stop harboring militants, praised Pakistan for its “cooperation on many fronts.” On Twitter, he wrote Friday that the U.S. is starting to develop “a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders.”  The operation appeared to have unfolded quickly and ended with what some described as a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor’s final, terrifying threat to “kill the hostage.” Boyle told his parents that he, his wife and their children were intercepted by Pakistani forces while being transported in the back or trunk of their captors’ car and that some of his captors were killed. He suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said.  U.S. officials did not confirm those details.  A U.S. military official said that a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan Wednesday prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go, but sometime after daybreak Thursday, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board, the official said.  Boyle’s father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base and the family wanted to return directly to North America. Another U.S. official said Boyle was nervous about being in “custody” given his family ties.  He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior al-Qaida financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy.  The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by U.S. troops following a firefight and was taken to the U.S. detention center at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle’s capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a “horrible coincidence.”  The U.S. Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman is wanted for any federal crime.  The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners, or he and his wife would be killed.  U.S. officials have said that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan.  They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had traveled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014.

33375,NOT_STRIKE,"MONS, Belgium (Reuters) - A new NATO military command centre to deter computer hackers should be fully staffed in 2023 and able to mount its own cyber attacks but the alliance is still grappling with ground rules for doing so, a senior general said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Military specialists work during the NATO Cyber Coalition exercise in Tartu, Estonia, November 29, 2017. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo While NATO does not have its own cyber weapons, the U.S.-led alliance established an operations centre on Aug. 31 at its military hub in Belgium. The United States, Britain, Estonia and other allies have since offered their cyber capabilities. “This is an emerging domain and the threat is growing,” said  Major General Wolfgang Renner, a German air force commander who oversees the new cyber operations centre, or CYOC, in Mons. “We have to be prepared, to be able to execute operations in cyberspace. We have already gone beyond protection and prevention,” he told Reuters during a NATO cyber conference. NATO communication and computer networks face hundreds of significant hacking attempts every month, according to the NATO Communication and Information Agency, while experts say Russia, North Korea and China are constantly deploying sophisticated computer hacking weapons and surveillance software. Accusations by Western governments this month that Russia waged a global hacking campaign have raised the profile of NATO’s evolving strategy as allied governments look for a response. The European Union on Monday discussed its options, including a special economic sanctions regime to target cyber attackers. “Our ultimate aim is to be completely aware of our cyberspace, to understand minute-by-minute the state of our networks so that commanders can rely on them,” said Ian West, chief of cyber security at the NATO communication agency. When fully operational, the cyber centre aims to coordinate NATO’s cyber deterrent through a 70-strong team of experts fed with military intelligence and real-time information about hackers ranging from Islamist militants to organised crime groups operating on behalf of hostile governments. ARTICLE 5 DEBATE NATO has formally recognised cyberspace as a new frontier in defence, along with land, air and sea, meaning battles could henceforth be waged on computer networks. The centre could potentially use cyber weapons that can knock out enemy missiles or air defences, or destroy foes’  computer networks if commanders judge such a cyber attack is less harmful to human life than a traditional offensive with live weaponry. That is now the subject of intense debate at NATO, with alliance commanders saying publicly that cyber will be an integral part of future warfare but allies unclear what would trigger NATO’s Article 5 (collective defence) clause. “Our concept of operations, a toolbox for short-notice decisions about how to respond, is not in place yet. This is one of the challenges we face,” Renner said. If NATO can agree cyber warfare principles, the alliance hopes to integrate individual nations’ cyber capabilities into alliance operations, coordinated through the Mons cyber operations centre and under the command of NATO’s top general, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, or SACEUR. That could allow the top general to take quick decisions on whether to use cyber weapons, similar to existing agreements for NATO’s air defences and its ballistic missile shield, where a commander has only minutes to decide what action to take. “From my point of view, this is basically possible, but it has to be arranged,” Renner said.

The officials said the deadline for the stay of the Afghan refugees has been further extended until 30th of June this year. According to the officials, refugees possessing Proof of Registration cards could continue to stay in the country until June 30 and that the same policy would also be applicable on those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACCs). This comes as the Pakistani officials had earlier announced that the Afghan refugees currently residing in Pakistan should return to their homeland until the end of March. In the meantime, efforts are underway in Afghanistan to pave the way for the return of the Afghan refugees from the neighboring countries, specifically Pakistan which currently hosts hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees. Speaking during a gathering to mark the 29th year of the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan in mid-February, President Ghani said the government is committed to bring changes in its priorities in a bid to pave the way for the return of the refugees. President Ghani further added that he wants all the refugees to return to the country in the next 24 months, insisting that the government does not want the issue of the refugees remain an excuse for the Pakistani authorities. President Ghani made the remarks in reaction to Pakistani officials’ remarks regarding the misuse of the refugees by the terror outfits. The foreign ministry of Pakistan in reaction to a drone strike on Haqqani terrorist network member said in January that “Pakistan has also been stressing the need of early repatriation of Afghan refugees as their presence in Pakistan helps Afghan terrorists to melt and morph among them.” The Minister of Interior of Pakistan Ahsan Iqbal had earlier said that the return of Afghan refugees is prerequisite to deny safe havens to the Afghan militants. Iqbal told reporters that around three million refugees still reside in Pakistan emphasizing that no one should expect that the country would be able to certify those involved in the cross-border terrorist activities.

Modi will meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas in an overture seen as India's effort to balance its decades-old support for the occupied territories against its growing closeness to Israel. The Indian premier will visit Ramallah first on his three-day tour of the region between February 9 and 12, which will also take in Oman and the United Arab Emirates. Foreign ministry official B. Bala Bhaskar said Modi's visit to Palestine would be his first, though the Indian premier has met Abbas on three previous occasions. The leaders are expected to discuss information technology, health and tourism during the brief visit, Bhaskar added. Modi will also address a joint press conference and attended a banquet. New Delhi has long backed Palestine's quest for nationhood and Modi has articulated support for an independent state existing peacefully alongside Israel. Bhaskar said India's refusal in December to support US moves to recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital was consistent with its unwavering support for Palestine. Ahead of the first visit by an Israeli leader to India in 15 years, Netanyahu said he was “disappointed” by India's decision. But any tension appeared forgotten as the two leaders embraced in New Delhi last month and heralded a “new era” between Israel and India as deals were signed on cybersecurity and energy. Modi became the first Indian leader in history to visit Israel in July 2017.

964,NOT_STRIKE," JERUSALEM — An Israeli company known for its sophisticated phone surveillance technology on Monday rejected accusations that its snooping software helped lead to the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  The NSO Group has faced similar claims in the past that its products were used to stifle dissent in other countries. But the alleged connection to the Khashoggi killing is the most high-profile case to date, drawing new attention to the secretive company’s business practices and the Israeli government’s oversight of private defense contractors.  The latest case against NSO was spelled out in a lawsuit filed in an Israeli court Sunday by a Saudi dissident. In the suit, Omar Abdulaziz, a sharp online critic of the Saudi royals who lives in exile in Canada, said he was friends with Khashoggi and that their communications were monitored by the Saudis using NSO software.  Abdulaziz said he clicked on a link sent to his phone in June 2018 that exposed his mobile communications to Saudi authorities. The lawsuit says Abdulaziz faced increased harassment by Saudi authorities after he clicked on the link, including the detention of family members in Saudi Arabia.  Abdulaziz also believes that his cooperation with Khashoggi was a “crucial factor” in the killing of the U.S.-based columnist for The Washington Post. The men had been working on a project to rein in pro-monarchy Saudi trolls.  Alaa Mahajna, a lawyer for the Saudi dissident, said the suit alleges that NSO sells technology to “dictatorship states” like Saudi Arabia to spy on journalists and human rights activists.  “The lawsuit proves that by using this technology, Saudi Arabia succeeded to follow after Jamal Khashoggi and his interactions with Omar Abdulaziz,” he said.  The lawsuit says Abdulaziz was notified that his phone was compromised by internet watchdog Citizen Lab. It cites news reports and other sources claiming that NSO Group sold Saudi Arabia the technology in 2017 for $55 million. Abdulaziz is demanding about $160,000 in damages and an order preventing NSO from selling its technology to Saudi Arabia.      NSO issued a statement calling the lawsuit “completely unfounded.”   NSO issued a statement calling the lawsuit “completely unfounded.” It claimed the suit was based on inaccurate “press clippings” and showed “no evidence that the company’s technology was used.”  “We take an extremely scrupulous approach to the licensing of our products — which are only provided after a full vetting and licensing by the Israeli government,” it said.  Israel’s Defense Ministry said it is “meticulous” in granting export licenses, but it declined to comment on its policies, citing security concerns.  The NSO Group’s smartphone-hacking technology has emerged as a favorite for authorities seeking to crush dissent across the Middle East and Latin America.  The Israeli firm’s software is part of a larger family of malware that allows spies to take remote control of phones from anywhere in the world — turning the devices in targets’ pockets into powerful surveillance tools.  The company said its products “are licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime in the modern age.”  Founded by Israeli entrepreneurs, NSO was sold in 2014 for $130 million to the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners. Today, it employs some 600 people and is believed to be valued at over $1 billion.  The secretive company rarely speaks to the media, does not publicly identify its customers and does not even have a website.  But a person familiar with NSO said the company keeps tight oversight over its sales. He said the company will not do business with 21 countries, including Russia, China and Turkey, as well as many others blocked by the Defense Ministry.  He also said NSO has an “ethics committee” that includes human rights experts and former U.S. officials that must vet every sale. He said the committee has blocked over $100 million in deals over the past three years, though he declined to elaborate. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing inside corporate information.  The company says it does not assist its customers in the actual monitoring process. But the person familiar with NSO said the company has a number of safeguards to prevent misuse of its products.  For instance, it can restrict in which countries the product will work, and it limits how many people can be targeted by its flagship “Pegasus” product. He estimated that at any given time, there are no more than 150 to 200 “targets” among all of its customers worldwide.  “We do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,” the NSO statement said.   President Trump announced he will not sanction Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Nick Schifrin reports, and the Washington Post’s Fred Hiatt joins Judy Woodruff to analyze the administration’s response to the international incident.  NSO has been under the spotlight for months as dissidents, journalists and other opposition figures have claimed the company’s technology has been used by repressive governments to spy on them. These include Mexican and Qatari journalists who have already filed lawsuits against the company and an Amnesty International employee who was allegedly targeted by the software.  Any possible use of Israeli technology to police dissent in the Arab world could raise uncomfortable questions both for Israel, which still sees itself as a bastion of democracy in the region, and for countries with no formal diplomatic ties to the Jewish state.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu frequently boasts of warming ties with Arab states, in what is widely seen as a reference to Saudi Arabia. Last month, Netanyahu paid a landmark visit to the Gulf state of Oman. He has promised that there will soon be additional announcements.  Any Israeli connection to the Khashoggi killing — even indirect or unintentional — could complicate Netanyahu’s strategy. It also could draw scrutiny to the Israeli Defense Ministry’s opaque export policies.  Itay Mack, an Israeli human rights lawyer who is highly critical of Israeli weapons exports, said the Defense Ministry has notoriously lax policies for the lucrative industry, giving Israel an advantage over competitors.  “What Israel is offering is no limitations,” he said. He noted that when Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte visited in September, for example, he praised the ease of buying Israeli weapons. “It’s the same story with spyware,” Mack said.  Mack filed a petition with an Israeli court last year to halt NSO’s use of its technology in Mexico after reports that it was being used to target human rights activists, lawyers and journalists. The court ruling remains under a gag order.

Despite the continuous fall in remittances from Saudi Arabia, the overall remittances increased with the help of UK and United States as both registered high growth. According to the State Bank’s latest data issued on Friday, the remittances from Saudi Arabia fell by 8.7pc to $3.26bn.  Saudi Arabia still provides highest remittances to Pakistan despite thousands of Pakistanis having lost their jobs in the last couple of years. From July-February FY17, remittances from Saudi Arabia fell by 6.8pc, reflecting the impact of job losses in the kingdom. The highest increase was noted from Britain as the remittances grew by 23.2pc to reach $1.786bn during the eight months of 2017-18. The inflows from United States also witnessed a sizable growth of 12.2pc to stand at $1.7bn in the same period.

133,NOT_STRIKE," Tensions escalated sharply on the Asian subcontinent Tuesday with nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and India trading accusations and warnings after a pre-dawn airstrike by India that New Delhi said targeted a terrorist training camp.  Pakistan said there were no casualties, while New Delhi called the attack a pre-emptive strike that hit a terrorist training camp and killed “a very large number” of militants.  The airstrike followed a suicide bombing in India’s section of the disputed territory of Kashmir on Feb. 14 that killed more than 40 Indian soldiers. Pakistan has denied involvement in the attack but vowed to respond to any Indian military operation against it.  Several reporters, including an Associated Press journalist, trudged up the Kangaran Nallah hill to the site of Tuesday’s bombing near the town of Balakot, close to the border with Pakistan’s sector of Kashmir. They saw several large craters, a few upended trees and villagers wondering why they had been targeted.  “There are only mud-brick homes here. There is no madrassas. There isn’t even a concrete house,” said 55-year-old Noor Shah who lived about a half-kilometer (a third of a mile) from the site.  When the bombs struck, Shah said residents of his village of Jabba stayed indoors. It wasn’t until morning when “we saw soldiers and learned from them that Indian planes dropped bombs in our village,” he said.  Two of the dried mud structures were damaged in the explosions but no one was hurt, said Tahir Khan, 45, of the same village. He added that his frightened children refused to let him leave their side to go to work.  “No one has been killed, no one has been seriously hurt. But we want to know, what have we done that we were attacked?” asked Khan.  Pakistan’s military spokesman, Maj. Gen Asif Ghafoor, said Indian planes crossed into the Muzafarabad sector of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. He said Pakistan scrambled its warplanes and the Indian jets released their payload “in haste” near Balakot.  India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters in New Delhi that Indian fighter jets targeted Jaish-e-Mohammad camps in a pre-emptive strike after intelligence indicated another attack was being planned.  “Acting on intelligence, India early today struck the biggest training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammad in Balakot,” he said. “In this operation, a very large number of Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and jihadis being trained were eliminated.”  Balakot Police Chief Saghir Hussain Shah said he had sent teams to the area where the Indian bombs reportedly hit, which he described as a mostly deserted wooded area. He said there were no casualties and no damage. There was no immediate explanation for the differing accounts, although India and Pakistan routinely contradict one another.  The Feb. 14 attack was the worst on Indian forces since the start of the 1989 insurgency in Kashmir and came as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in a re-election campaign.  Addressing a rally of former soldier’s in the Indian state of Rajasthan hours after the airstrike, Modi said India was in “safe hands.”  “I vow that I will not let the country bow down,” he said.  Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi condemned Tuesday’s incursion, saying New Delhi had “endangered” peace in the region for political gains.  Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan dismissed India’s account of the airstrike on a terrorist training camp as “self-serving, reckless and fictitious.” Earlier this month, Khan had authorized the army to “respond decisively and comprehensively to any aggression or misadventure” by India, after New Delhi vowed a “jaw-breaking response” to the Kashmir suicide bombing.  Pakistan has vowed to help investigate the suicide bombing and to take action against anyone found to be using Pakistani soil for attacks on India. It also offered to hold a dialogue with India on all issues, including terrorism.  Kashmir, which is split between the two countries but claimed by each in its entirety, has been the cause of two wars between the neighbors. They fought a third war in 1979 over East Pakistan, which gained independence with the help of India and became Bangladesh.  Insurgents in Indian-controlled Kashmir have been demanding either outright independence or union with Pakistan. India routinely accuses Pakistan of arming and training militants who cross the mountainous Himalayan region.  The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing. The bomber, who made a video beforehand, was a resident of Indian-controlled sector of Kashmir.  Muhammad Amir Rana, a security analyst and executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, urged the international community to move quickly to de-escalate tensions.  “It’s quite critical and it is important that the international community intervene quickly to start a peace process between India and Pakistan,” he said, adding that the United States, China and Russia should take the lead.  China, a close ally of Pakistan, urged both sides to show restraint.  “We hope that both India and Pakistan can ... take actions that will help stabilize the situation in the region and help to improve mutual relations,” said China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang.  Pakistan has outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammad and seized its property in south Punjab’s Bawahalpur area, including religious schools and mosques. India has demanded that Jaish-e-Mohammad’s leader, Azhar Masood, be listed as a terrorist by the U.N., but that has been stymied by China.  After the airstrike, Lt. Col. Devender Anand, an Indian army spokesman, said Pakistani soldiers attacked Indian positions along the boundary in Kashmir, the so-called Line of Control. He called the attack an “unprovoked” violation of the 2003 cease-fire. He said there were no casualties and refused to discuss India’s incursion into Pakistan.  Residents of Chikhoti, on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control, said they heard the roar of Indian jets overhead. They said they had been expecting an Indian response to the suicide bombing.  “We built bunkers near our home years ago and we will use them if there is any attack from India in our area,” said Mohammad Shafiq, 55.  Later Tuesday evening, Anand said Pakistani soldiers fired mortar shells and small-arms fire along the Line of Control at the Nowshera, Poonch and Akhnoor sectors, prompting Indian troops to “strongly and befittingly” respond.  Shakir Ahmed, a resident of Poonch in Indian-controlled Kashmir, said people heard loud sounds of shelling.  “People are afraid.

15787,NOT_STRIKE,"WASHINGTON: The United States has assured Pakistan that it does not want to sever bilateral ties with this important ally while Islamabad extended its “wholehearted support” to the US-backed Afghan offer of peace talks with the Taliban. The two statements supplement renewed efforts to improve relations between the US and Pakistan which were once close allies in the war against terror. The move for improving ties began last week when Washington sent a senior Trump aide to Islamabad for talks with Pakistani leaders. And on Thursday, official sources in Washington told Dawn that Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua will visit Washington next week for a series of meetings with senior American officials. In an interview to VOA radio in Kabul on Friday, US State Department’s Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Alice Wells said the US was not thinking of cutting ties with Pakistan. She also assured Islamabad that the US considered Pakistan essential to resolving the Afghan imbroglio. Asked if Washington could sever its relations with Pakistan, Ms Well said: “On the contrary, we are backing Pakistan against all militant groups.” In Islamabad, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif told reporters that Pakistan “wholeheartedly supports Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s latest offer of peace talks to the Taliban because “it’s a good move and a healthy move towards restoring peace in Afghanistan”. Earlier, a top US general also dispelled the impression that the United States and Pakistan were on a collision course. “We have preserved the valuable military-to-military relationship with Pakistan” while working to increase transparency and communication with military leaders, Gen Joseph Votel, head of the US Central Command told a congressional panel in Washington this week. In Washington, diplomatic observers are describing Foreign Secretary Janjua’s March 6-8 visit to Washington as a positive development, noting that it follows a surprise trip to Islamabad last week by a senior Trump official, Lisa Curtis, who spoke of the need to build a new relationship with Pakistan after her talks with senior Pakistani officials. Official sources told Dawn that Secretary Janjua is also slated to visit Nepal next week with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi but may have to skip that trip for important bilateral talks in Washington, which may include another meeting with Ms Curtis, the US National Security Council’s senior director for South and Central Asia.

2351,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — One U.S. special operations soldier was killed and four U.S. service members wounded in an “enemy attack” Friday in Somalia, the U.S. military said — casualties that are likely to put renewed scrutiny on America’s counterterror operations in Africa.  It’s the first public announcement of a U.S. military combat death on the continent since four U.S. service members were killed in a militant ambush in the west African nation of Niger in October.  President Donald Trump paid tribute on Twitter Friday night, offering “thoughts and prayers” to the families of the soldier who was killed and those who were wounded. “They are truly all HEROES,” he tweeted.  U.S. Africa Command said in a statement that U.S. troops with Somali and Kenyan forces came under mortar and small-arms fire in Jubaland, Somalia, at around 2.45 p.m. local time.  One member of the “partner forces” was wounded. One of the wounded U.S. service members received sufficient medical care in the field, and the other three were medically evacuated for additional treatment.  The statement did not identify the attackers but said a larger force of about 800 Somali and Kenyan troops were conducting a multi-day operation against al-Shabab militants about 350 kilometers (217 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred. The operation aimed to clear the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab from contested areas. The U.S. provided advice, assistance and aerial surveillance during the mission, the statement said.  Al-Shabab claimed credit for the attack, the SITE Intelligence Group said in a statement Friday.  The U.S. has about 1,000 special operations personnel in Africa. The last killing of a U.S. service member in Somalia was in May 2017 during an operation about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Mogadishu.  Myeshia Johnson, wife of U.S. Army Sergeant La David Johnson, who was among four special forces soldiers killed in Niger, kisses his coffin at a graveside service in Hollywood, Florida, October 21, 2017.  Photo by Reuters.  The U.S. had pulled out of the Horn of Africa nation after 1993, when two helicopters were shot down in Mogadishu and bodies of Americans were dragged through the streets.  But Trump in early 2017 approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, leading to an increase in U.S. military personnel to more than 500 and the launch of dozens of drone strikes. Al-Shabab has been blamed for the October truck bombing in Mogadishu that killed more than 500 people.  Al-Shabab, linked to al-Qaida, seeks to establish an Islamic state in Somalia. It was pushed out of Mogadishu in recent years but continues to control rural areas in the south and central regions. Its fighters continue to attack the bases of a multinational African Union force that remains largely responsible for security as Somalia’s fragile central government tries to recover from decades of chaos.  The U.S. military and others have expressed concern about the 21,000-strong AU force’s plan to withdraw by 2020 and hand over security responsibilities to Somali forces, saying the local troops are not ready.  Late last year U.S. drone strikes also began targeting a small presence of fighters linked to the Islamic State group in Somalia’s north.  Somali officials have said civilians have been killed in more than one joint U.S. military operation with Somali forces. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Africa Command issued a statement in response to allegations that civilians had been killed in a May 9 operation, saying a “thorough review” found the allegations to be “not credible.”  The October attack in Niger raised questions in Washington about the U.S. military presence across Africa as the Trump administration focuses counterterror efforts on a range of groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.  A Pentagon investigation into the Niger attack, parts of which were made public last month, found multiple failures but none that directly caused the ambush by Islamic State group-linked fighters.  The investigation has already triggered changes in the way military activities are carried out in Niger and elsewhere in Africa, including giving teams the option to use heavily armored vehicles and beefed-up firepower.  ____  Anna contributed from Johannesburg, South Africa.

The airstrike was carried out along the Durand Line in a remote area of Pakistan, southwest of the town of Ahmad Wal. Mansoor was reportedly travelling a vehicle which was targeted by multiple drones, a senior US defense official has said. The US Department of Defense confirmed Saturday “Today, the Department of Defense conducted an airstrike that targeted Taliban leader Mullah Mansur in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. Mansur has been the leader of the Taliban and actively involved with planning attacks against facilities in Kabul and across Afghanistan, presenting a threat to Afghan civilians and security forces, our personnel, and coalition partners.” “Mansur has been an obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the Government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government that could lead to an end to the conflict,” a statement by DoD said. The statement further added “Since the death of Mullah Omar and Mansur’s assumption of leadership, the Taliban have conducted many attacks that have resulted in the death of tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and Afghan security forces as well as numerous U.S. and coalition personnel. We are still assessing the results of the strike and will provide more information as it becomes available.” The former Afghan intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil has also written regarding the airstrike targeting Mansoor in his Twitter account. “Akhtar Mansoor joined Mullah Omar, he was living in Gardi Jangal area of Quetta, Pakistan. Seems it was a good airstrike by US,” the Twitter post by Nabil said. If confirmed, the death would be a serious blow to the organization. Mansoor became its leader last July, when it was revealed that reclusive long-time head, Mullah Omar, had died two years prior. Mansoor had been his deputy. The appointment of Mullah Mansoor as the new Supreme Leader of Taliban led to widening rift among the Taliban ranks which resulted into deadly clashes on numerous occassions among his supporters and the dissident Taliban leaders. Mansoor was however supported by the notorious Haqqani terrorist network which is also believed to be based in Pakistan as the network’s leader was appointed as the deputy chief of the Taliban group.

5359,NOT_STRIKE," Syria’s northern city of Aleppo was once a thriving commercial hub with a proud history dating back millennia. Since the Syrian civil war began in 2011, much of the city has been devastated by intense shelling and airstrikes.  As government forces work to wrest back control of Aleppo from an armed rebellion, which is battling against the Assad family’s 40-year rule, aid groups are cautioning that civilians have fewer places to go while their city gets hammered. The U.N. human rights office said Tuesday that government forces had killed at least 82 civilians in the eastern neighborhoods, reported the AFP .  “The worst humanitarian tragedy of the 21st century is unfolding before our eyes,” said France’s U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre, according to the Associated Press.      “It will never be rebuilt in the same way. It will never be this living museum at the crossroads of civilization.” — correspondent Courtney Kealy   Overall, more than 250,000 people have died in the five-year conflict, and repeated attempts to broker a cease-fire have failed.  Courtney Kealy , a television and radio correspondent now based in New York, remembers visiting Syria for the first time in 1999 to do a travel piece for the New York Times.  She covered a Sufi concert in an 8th century palace, watched artisans hand print designs on fabric and bought strands of natural pearls for her family.  Aleppo epitomized Syria’s place on the Silk Road ancient trading route. “The souk (open-air market) was so narrow that you could only send goods through by donkey. You just felt like you’d stepped into another century.”  Now, looking at the images of the destruction is heartbreaking, Kealy says. “It will never be rebuilt in the same way. It will never be this living museum at the crossroads of civilization.”  Reuters photographers have documented the city before and after the war began, in these 2009 images and others taken in the past few days.

12635,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama at the White House Friday over the stern objection of China, which warned the meeting would “inflict grave damages” on the U.S. relationship with the Asian nation.  Obama greeted the Dalai Lama while the Tibetan spiritual leader and fellow Nobel laureate was in the U.S. on a speaking tour. The meeting was closed to photographers, and, unlike during some previous visits, the Dalai Lama departed the White House without speaking to reporters.  In a statement after the meeting, the White House said Obama offered his “strong support for the preservation of Tibet’s unique religious, cultural, and linguistic traditions” and for human rights protections for Tibetans in China. The Dalai Lama told Obama he’s not seeking Tibetan independence, and both leaders said they hoped talks would resume between Beijing and the Dalai Lama’s representatives.  When the White House announced the meeting late Thursday, China responded almost immediately, urging Obama to cancel it in what has become something of a diplomatic ritual whenever the president meets with the exiled Buddhist monk. In a biting statement, China’s government accused Obama of letting the Dalai Lama use the White House to promote anti-Chinese activities.  “It is a severe violation of the principles of international relations,” said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China’s Foreign Ministry. “It will inflict grave damages upon the China-U.S. relationship.”  Beijing has often protested when world leaders have granted audiences to the Dalai Lama, including when Obama met with him in 2010 and again in 2011. Chinese officials denounce the Dalai Lama as a separatist responsible for instigating self-immolations by Tibetans inside China, but he is widely respected around the world for his advocacy of peace and tolerance.  Obama hosted the Dalai Lama in the White House’s Map Room, rather than the Oval Office, where the president traditionally brings a visiting leader for a round of photographs. The private meeting, closed to reporters despite media requests for access, suggested an attempt to avoid the appearance of a formal meeting between two heads of state.  The White House said Obama was meeting with the Dalai Lama in the visitor’s capacity as a cultural and religious leader. As if to indicate a reaction had been expected, officials reiterated that the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and doesn’t support Tibetan independence.  At the same time, officials said they were concerned about tensions and deteriorating human rights in China’s Tibetan areas, urging Beijing to resume talks with the Dalai Lama or his followers without preconditions.  China bitterly opposes the Dalai Lama’s quest for greater Tibetan autonomy and is wary of Obama’s efforts to increase U.S. influence in the region.  Relations between the U.S. and China are already on edge over Beijing’s increasingly aggressive steps to assert itself in the region, including in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors. China’s emergence as a leading global economic and military power has strained ties with Washington, and the two have also clashed over cybertheft and human rights.

Ben Emmerson QC, the UN’s special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights returning from a three-day visit to Islamabad said  he had been given assurances that there was no “tacit consent by Pakistan to the use of drones on its territory”. Emmerson’s investigation team has gathered numerous reports from residents who witnessed the terrifying attacks. “Adult males carrying out ordinary daily tasks were frequently the victims of such strikes,” a statement from the UN office for human rights said. The strikes have sparked growing controversy due to their secret nature. However, the US has denied that its attacks have killed hundreds of people. President Barack Obama has stepped up covert CIA drone strikes targeting al-Qaida and Taliban militants in Pakistan’s tribal region along the Afghan border since he took office in 2009. The strikes have caused growing controversy because of the secrecy surrounding them and claims that they have caused significant civilian casualties – allegations denied by the United States. CIA director John Brennan has said that only in “exceedingly rare” cases have civilians been “accidentally injured, or worse, killed in these strikes.” However reports by independent groups corroborate Emmerson’s account, concluding that drones mistakenly target and kill a significant number of civilians. The New America Foundation estimates that in Pakistan, drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 – and that between 18% and 23% of them were not militants.

The probe delegation headed by Afghan parliament member Abdul Satar Khawasi, who had called on the residents of Ghorband district for Jihad against the US forces. An examination of the dossier which contains images and videos, has revealed that the probe team falsely represented at least some of the evidence in the dossier, and distributed other material whose provenance, at best, could not be determined, the New York Times reported. The examination of the documents has further revealed that much of the same material was posted on a Taliban website last week, a rare instance of the militant group’s political speech matching that of the government it is fighting to topple. According to the New York Times, at least two of the images distributed in the dossier could not have shown casualties from airstrike, as one image was taken at the funeral of victims of a NATO airstrike in northern Afghanistan in 2009, and the second photo shows the bodies of two boys wrapped in burial shrouds, and has been used for years on websites assailing civilian deaths in American drone strikes in Pakistan. The probe team had claimed at least 12 civilians including women and children were killed in the airstrike conducted by NATO forces in Siah Gerd district of Parwan province. However, Parwan governor, Abdul Basir Salangi also denied the findings of the probe team and said the death toll was in the single digits and those claiming higher deaths tolls were “supporters of the Taliban.” Mr. Salangi further added that no members of the commission seemed to have visited the area, and the interviews and photographs along with the video were prepared by driver of Khawasi and his bodyguard.

39345,NOT_STRIKE,"The US government has reportedly named Army Lt. Gen. Austin Scott Miller as the new commander of the US forces in Afghanistan. Reports regarding the nomination of Gen. Miller as the new commander of US forces in Afghanistan emerges amid ongoing efforts to defeat the 17-year long insurgency in Afghanistan led mainly by the Taliban. Despite the announcement of the new strategy for South Asia, mainly focusing on increased pressures on Taliban, fewer strategic successes have been achieved in the past few months. According to TIME Magazine, selection of Miller indicates the Trump Administration may be rethinking its conventional approach. Gen. Miller’s 35-year background draws on decades of experience in commanding clandestine commando teams, working with foreign partners, and collaborating with intelligence agencies to target terror groups — often resulting in drone strikes and nighttime raids. According to the TIME, Miller has his work cut out for him. Afghan forces remain riddled with corruption and heavily reliant upon American intelligence and firepower to maintain a semblance of control of their country. The central government held just 56% of the country’s 407 districts, as of Jan. 31. In the meantime, Ronald E. Neumann, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served as ambassador to Afghanistan, Bahrain and Algeria, has told TIME that “I don’t know if anyone can solve Afghanistan’s problems. If the Trump Administration stays committed, I’m confident Scott Miller will deliver positive results.” Michael Mullen, a retired Navy admiral who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has told the TIME that Miller’s rare mix of combat experience, oversight of training missions, and interest in Afghan culture makes him the “best athlete” the military has to offer in taking command in Afghanistan.

He said the airstrike mistakenly targeted the security forces due to a false coordination given by the security forces on the ground. Waziri further added that the Afghan Air Force helicopters bombed the security forces and a delegation has been assigned to further investigate the incident. This comes as reports emerged earlier suggesting that the 5 commandos and a policeman were killed in an airstrike carried out by the US forces in Afghanistan.

40993,NOT_STRIKE,"US Ambassador to Pakistan, Richard Olson, has said drone strikes in Pakistan would continue until terror havens in the tribal areas of the country are eliminated. This comes as US Central Intelligence Agency will be allowed to continue its campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan for a year or more under a new detailed counter-terrorism manual, Washington Post reported. The classified manual, called a counterterrorism “playbook,” sets out stringent rules with regard to US targeted killings, but it incorporates a carve-out that would allow the CIA to continue bombing suspected militants in Pakistan for “less than two years but more than one.” According to the London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism, between 2,627 and 3,457 people have been reportedly killed by US drones in Pakistan since 2004, including between 475 and nearly 900 civilians. The covert strikes are publicly criticised by the Pakistani government as a violation of sovereignty but American officials believe they are a vital weapon in the war against militants. Granting the CIA a temporary exemption for its Pakistan operations was described by officials cited by the Post as a “compromise that allowed officials to move forward with other parts of the playbook”. The Post said the adoption of a formal guide to targeted killing marks a significant milestone: the institutionalisation of a practice that would have seemed anathema to many before the September 11, 2001 attacks.

4007,NOT_STRIKE," ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ — High above the Persian Gulf, an Iranian drone crosses the path of American fighter jets lining up to land on the USS Nimitz.  The drone buzzes across the sky more than a mile above the massive aircraft carrier and is spotted by the fighters. It is unarmed.  But for the senior Navy commanders on the ship, the presence of the enemy drone so close is worrying. Their biggest fear is the surveillance aircraft will start carrying weapons, posing a more direct threat to U.S. vessels transiting one of the world’s most significant strategic and economic international waterways.  “It’s just a matter of time before we see that,” said Navy Rear Adm. Bill Byrne, commander of the carrier strike group that includes the Nimitz. He said the Iranian drone activity has “generated a lot of discussion” and was becoming an increasingly pressing matter of concern.  If, at some point, Byrne believes a drone is threatening his ship, he and his staff would have to carefully proceed through the required responses — efforts at communication, sounding the horn, firing flares and warning shots, and flying a helicopter close to the unmanned vehicle. If all those efforts fail and he still perceives a threat, Byrne said it would be his duty, his “responsibility,” to shoot down the Iranian drone.  So far, it hasn’t come to that. But the drones have become an even more dangerous security risk as U.S. carriers in the Persian Gulf like the Nimitz play a key role in Iraq and Syria. Planes from these ships are regularly flying to each country to bomb militants fighting with the Islamic State group and other targets. From the Nimitz alone, U.S. fighter jets flew missions resulting in at least 350 bombs being dropped on IS militants just in the last month.  Iran has routinely challenged U.S. ships and aircraft across the Gulf, asserting at times that the entire waterway is its territory. Navy commanders say Iran’s unpredictable behavior is the biggest safety hazard.  “Iranians don’t always follow the rules,” Byrne said. “There is a well-established set of norms, standards and laws. They don’t tend to follow them.”  To counter the threat, Pentagon experts are searching for new ways to deter, defeat or disable the drones. According to Byrne and Cdr. Dave Kurtz, the Nimitz’s executive officer, Iranian drones fly over the carrier strike group almost daily.  They said the danger is that as the F/A-18 fighters return from their missions in Iraq and Syria, they circle overhead, lining up for their turn to land on the carrier. Even if the Iranian drones are only meant to annoy, their buzzing across the American flight paths risks an accident.  Up in the carrier’s control room, a book on Iranian naval and maritime forces sits above the radar screen. Commanders on the ship announce when a drone appears. Then, they go through a careful, planned response of attempted radio calls and warnings.  Gen. Joseph Votel, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, visited the Nimitz on Thursday, also stopping on the nearby USS Vella Gulf, a guided missile cruiser. The drone, he said, also flew over that ship.  “The proliferation of drones is a real challenge,” said Votel, who was finishing his 10-day trip to the Middle East and Afghanistan. “It’s growing exponentially.”  Speaking with traveling reporters, Votel said the Pentagon has sought to devise more high-tech ways to handle the drones through the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization, originally set up in 2006 to counter improvised explosive devices used by insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan to kill and maim American troops.  Much as it did with that decade-old roadside bomb battle, the organization now focuses on how to deal with Iran’s drones, Votel said. He didn’t provide details, but he acknowledged that U.S. cyber capabilities could be used to defeat a drone or the network controlling it.  The military is training troops on drone response, he said. But right now, said Byrne, they’re still following their normal procedures. And he still hasn’t been forced to shoot one down.  Byrne described how a helicopter from the Nimitz flew by the drone to ensure it wasn’t weaponized. In the month the Nimitz has been in the Gulf, efforts to speak with the drone operators have been hit or miss, he said.  “Sometimes they answer, sometimes they don’t,” he said, echoing experiences American forces have had with small Iranian fast boats that pose a similar threat of coming too close by sea.  When the Iranians do answer, Byrne said, they often “challenge our assertion that they are flying into danger.” The drones fly out of airfields up and down the Iranian coast, mainly watching U.S. ships and taking photos.  On Thursday, the Nimitz was about 40 miles from the Iranian coast, halfway between the Islamic Republic and Saudi Arabia.

688,NOT_STRIKE," WASHINGTON — Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine arrested in Russia on espionage charges, was visiting Moscow over the holidays to attend a wedding when he suddenly disappeared, his brother said Tuesday.  Whelan, 48, who is head of global security for a Michigan-based auto parts supplier, was arrested on Friday. In announcing the arrest three days later, the Russian Federal Security Service said he was caught “during an espionage operation,” but gave no details.  “We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being,” his family said in a statement that his brother David Whelan posted on Twitter. “His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected.”      “We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being.”   The Russian spying charges carry a prison sentence of up to 20 years.  David Whelan said in an interview that his brother had been to Russia several times previously, so when a fellow former Marine was planning a wedding in Moscow with a Russian woman he was asked to come along to help out.  The morning of his arrest, he had taken a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums. The last time anyone heard from him was at about 5 p.m. and then he failed to show up that evening for the wedding, his brother said. “It was extraordinarily out of character,” he said.  The family feared he had been mugged or was in a car accident, David Whelan said, and it was when searching the internet on Monday that he learned of the arrest. “I was looking for any stories about dead Americans in Moscow, so in a way it was better than finding out that he had died,” he said.  The State Department said Monday it had received formal notification from the Russian Foreign Ministry of the arrest and was pushing for consular access. David Whelan said the family was told by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow they have not been able to speak to Paul Whelan.  David Whelan said he has no idea why his brother was targeted by the Russian security services. Paul Whelan had traveled to Russia in the past for work and to visit friends he had met on social networks, his brother said.      The morning of his arrest, he had taken a group of wedding guests on a tour of the Kremlin museums.   Paul Whelan did multiple tours in Iraq with the Marine Corps, his brother said. He now lives in Novi, Michigan, and is director of global security for BorgWarner, where he has worked since early 2017. “He is responsible for overseeing security at our facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan and at other company locations around the world,” company spokeswoman Kathy Graham said in a statement. She said BorgWarner does not have any facilities in Russia.  He previously worked for Kelly Services, which does maintain offices in Russia, his brother said.  The arrest comes as U.S.-Russian ties are severely strained, in part over Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.  A Russian gun-rights activist, Maria Butina, is in U.S. custody after admitting she acted as a secret agent for the Kremlin in trying to infiltrate conservative U.S. political groups as Donald Trump was seeking the presidency.
